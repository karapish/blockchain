# ERC20 + Ownable (Mint/Burn) Specification

# üîπ Goal of This Contract
The goal is to create a **basic cryptocurrency token** (like a mini version of USDC or DAI) where:
- The token follows the **ERC20 standard** (so wallets & exchanges know how to handle it).
- One special account (the **owner**) has the power to:
  - **Mint** new tokens (create them out of thin air).
  - **Burn** tokens (destroy them).

This is useful for:
- Testing how tokens work.
- Learning about smart contracts.
- Creating tokens for apps, games, or even real projects.

---

# üîπ What kind of accounts are used?

1. **Externally Owned Account (EOA)**
  - Normal wallet like **MetaMask** or Coinbase Wallet.
  - Controlled by a private key.
  - Can send transactions to the blockchain.
  - Example: when you deploy this token, your EOA becomes the **owner**.

2. **Contract Account**
  - Lives on Ethereum (or an L2 like Base, Arbitrum, Optimism).
  - Contains **code** and **storage**.
  - Cannot act by itself ‚Äî it only runs when an EOA (or another contract) calls it.
  - Example: our **ERC20 contract** is a contract account.

---

### üîπ Is this token stable?
- **No ‚Äî by default it is not stable.**
- The ERC20 contract we built is just a **generic token**:
  - It can be minted and burned by the owner.
  - Its value is **not pegged** to USD or any asset.
  - Its price/value depends only on what people are willing to trade it for.

---

### üîπ What makes a token "stable"?
A **stablecoin** (like USDC, USDT, DAI) keeps its price close to $1 by:
1. **Backed reserves:** Each token is backed by dollars or assets held by a company (e.g., Circle for USDC).
2. **Overcollateralization:** Like DAI, users lock ETH/other crypto worth more than $1 to mint 1 DAI.
3. **Algorithms:** Some try to balance supply/demand automatically (these are riskier).

---

### üîπ Our Token
- It‚Äôs just an **ERC20 with mint/burn powers**.
- Nothing enforces stability ‚Üí if you mint 1,000 tokens, they might be worth $0 or $10 each depending on markets.

---

‚úÖ **In short:**  
The contract we wrote is **not a stablecoin**. It‚Äôs just a standard ERC20 token.  
To make it *stable*, you‚Äôd need a mechanism (reserves, collateral, or algorithm) to peg its value to something like USD.


# üîπ What makes a token ERC-20 compliant?

ERC-20 is an **Ethereum standard** that says:  
‚ÄúIf you want your token to work with wallets, exchanges, and dApps, your smart contract must include these specific functions and events.‚Äù

---

## ‚úÖ Required Functions
1. `totalSupply()` ‚Üí how many tokens exist in total.
2. `balanceOf(address)` ‚Üí how many tokens does this address hold.
3. `transfer(address to, uint256 value)` ‚Üí send tokens to someone.
4. `approve(address spender, uint256 value)` ‚Üí let someone else spend your tokens.
5. `allowance(address owner, address spender)` ‚Üí check how many tokens they are allowed to spend.
6. `transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 value)` ‚Üí move tokens on behalf of someone else (using their allowance).

---

## ‚úÖ Required Events
1. `Transfer(address from, address to, uint256 value)`
  - Must be emitted when tokens are sent (including mint & burn).
2. `Approval(address owner, address spender, uint256 value)`
  - Must be emitted when an allowance is set/changed.

---

## üîπ Why this matters
- Wallets like MetaMask, explorers like Etherscan, and DeFi apps look for these exact functions.
- If they exist and behave correctly ‚Üí your token is **ERC-20 compliant**.
- If not ‚Üí your token might not show up or won‚Äôt work properly.

---

# üîπ Scenarios for ERC-20 Functions

### 1. `totalSupply()`
- Scenario: An exchange or explorer (like Etherscan) wants to show **how many tokens exist in total**.
- Example: "This token has 1,000,000 total supply."

---

### 2. `balanceOf(address)`
- Scenario: A wallet (MetaMask) needs to display your balance.
- Example: You open your wallet ‚Üí it calls `balanceOf(0xYourAddress)`.

---

### 3. `transfer(address to, uint256 value)`
- Scenario: You want to **send tokens** to a friend.
- Example: Alice calls `transfer(Bob, 100)` ‚Üí Bob gets 100 tokens.

---

### 4. `approve(address spender, uint256 value)`
- Scenario: You want to allow a dApp or smart contract to use your tokens.
- Example: Before swapping on Uniswap, you must `approve(Uniswap, 100)` so it can pull your tokens.

---

### 5. `allowance(address owner, address spender)`
- Scenario: A dApp checks **how many tokens it is allowed to spend on your behalf**.
- Example: Uniswap checks `allowance(Alice, Uniswap)` to see if Alice approved enough.

---

### 6. `transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 value)`
- Scenario: A smart contract executes the actual transfer **using the approved allowance**.
- Example: After Alice approved Uniswap, Uniswap calls `transferFrom(Alice, Pool, 100)` to move tokens.

---

# üîπ Required Events

### `Transfer`
- Scenario: Whenever tokens move (mint, burn, send).
- Example: Etherscan shows "Alice ‚Üí Bob: 100 tokens" by listening to this event.

### `Approval`
- Scenario: Whenever an approval is set or changed.
- Example: Wallet shows "Alice approved Uniswap to spend 100 tokens."

---

‚úÖ **In short:**
- **Wallets** use `balanceOf`, `totalSupply`.
- **Users** use `transfer`.
- **dApps/DEXs** use `approve`, `allowance`, `transferFrom`.
- **Block explorers** use `Transfer` and `Approval` events to show activity.


‚úÖ **In short:**  
A token is ERC-20 compliant if it **follows the standard interface** of functions + events.  
This makes it plug-and-play with wallets, exchanges, and dApps in the Ethereum ecosystem.

# üîπ How it works step by step

1. **Deployment**
  - You (an EOA) deploy the smart contract.
  - The contract becomes a **contract account** on-chain.
  - Your EOA is set as the **owner**.

2. **Minting**
  - Only the **owner** can create new tokens.
  - Example: owner calls `mint(alice, 1000)` ‚Üí Alice‚Äôs balance increases by 1000.

3. **Transferring**
  - Any token holder (EOA or contract) can send tokens to another account.
  - Example: Alice calls `transfer(bob, 100)` ‚Üí Bob gets 100 tokens.

4. **Burning**
  - Token holder can destroy their own tokens (`burn`).
  - Owner can destroy tokens from anyone‚Äôs balance (`burnFrom`).

---

# üîπ Key Point
- **You (an EOA)** = owner, the one with special mint/burn powers.
- **The smart contract** = contract account, the ‚Äúrules engine‚Äù that manages balances.
- **Other EOAs** = regular users, they can hold, transfer, approve, and burn their own tokens.

---

‚úÖ **In short:**
- EOAs = wallets, controlled by humans.
- Contract accounts = smart contracts with code.
- This project = an ERC20 contract account controlled by an EOA (the owner) that can mint & burn tokens.


## üîπ In-Scope
- Implementation of a minimal ERC20 token with:
    - **Ownable** access control (single `owner` account).
    - **Minting**: owner can mint tokens to any address.
    - **Burning**:
        - Owner can burn from any account (`burnFrom`).
        - Holders can burn their own tokens (`burn`).
- Events for transparency (`Transfer`, `Approval`, `OwnershipTransferred`).

## üîπ Out-of-Scope
- No advanced ERC20 extensions (EIP-2612 permit, snapshots, etc.).
- No role-based access control (RBAC) beyond single owner.
- No pausing/emergency stop logic.
- No cross-chain bridges or upgradeability.
- No fee-on-transfer or taxation logic.

## üîπ Deliverable
- A single Solidity contract: **Ownable + ERC20 Mint/Burn**.
- Fully compilable with Solidity `^0.8.20`.
- Minimal dependencies (no external libraries).

## üîπ Acceptance Criteria
1. Contract compiles successfully.
2. Owner is correctly set to `msg.sender` at deployment.
3. Owner can `mint` and `burnFrom`.
4. Non-owners cannot `mint` or `burnFrom`.
5. Token holder can `burn` their own tokens.
6. Transfers, approvals, and allowances function per ERC20 standard.
7. Events (`Transfer`, `Approval`, `OwnershipTransferred`) emit correctly.
8. Total supply always consistent with balances.

## üîπ Test Plan
- **Network targets**:
    - **Testnets**: Sepolia, Holesky, Base Sepolia, Arbitrum Sepolia, Optimism Sepolia.
    - **Mainnet**: Ethereum or supported L2s once validated.

- **Tools**:
    - [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) or [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/).
    - [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/) or [web3.js](https://web3js.org/).
    - [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) + Mocha for assertions (if using JS tests).
    - [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) for quick prototyping.

- **Tests**:
    - Deploy and verify owner = deployer.
    - Owner mints tokens to an account.
    - Account successfully transfers tokens.
    - Account approves + transferFrom works.
    - Account burns its tokens.
    - Owner burns tokens from another account.
    - Attempting to mint/burnFrom as non-owner reverts.

üîπ Non-Payable Constructor

A non-payable constructor does not accept ETH during deployment.
If someone tries to send ETH while deploying, the transaction will revert.

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract PayableExample {
uint256 public amount;

    constructor() payable {
        // Contract can receive ETH here
        amount = msg.value; // stores how much ETH was sent at deploy
    }
}
```


üîπ Payable Constructor

A payable constructor allows the contract to receive ETH at deployment.
The received ETH will be stored in the contract‚Äôs balance.

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract PayableExample {
    uint256 public amount;

    constructor() payable {
        // Contract can receive ETH here
        amount = msg.value; // stores how much ETH was sent at deploy
    }
}
```

üîπ Forward ETH on Deploy
You can even deploy a contract and instantly forward the ETH it receives to another wallet or contract.

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract ForwardOnDeploy {
    address payable public recipient;

    constructor(address payable _recipient) payable {
        recipient = _recipient;

        // Forward any ETH sent on deployment to recipient
        if (msg.value > 0) {
            recipient.transfer(msg.value);
        }
    }
}
```

üîπ Example with Two Modifiers

Modifiers act like wrappers around function execution.
Here, we use onlyOwner and notLocked modifiers.

```aiignore
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract MultiModifier {
    address public owner;
    bool public locked;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    // Modifier 1: only owner can call
    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Not owner");
        _; // continue execution
    }

    // Modifier 2: function not locked
    modifier notLocked() {
        require(!locked, "Function locked");
        _; // continue execution
    }

    // Function with 2 modifiers
    function doSomething() external onlyOwner notLocked {
        // This runs only if both checks passed
        locked = true;
    }
}
```
Execution Flow:
1.	onlyOwner check runs ‚Üí must be owner.
2.	notLocked check runs ‚Üí must not be locked.
3.	Function body executes ‚Üí locked = true.

üëâ Order matters: onlyOwner notLocked is not the same as notLocked onlyOwner.
