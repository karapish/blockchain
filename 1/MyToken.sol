/**
 * MyToken is a minimal ERC-20-style token implementation.
 * It does not include every optional feature of the standard, but it covers:
 * - balanceOf: how many tokens each address has.
 * - totalSupply: total number of tokens in existence.
 * - transfer: send tokens to another address.
 * - approve: let someone else spend your tokens up to a limit.
 * - transferFrom: spend from someone else's balance using an allowance.
 * - mint: owner can create new tokens (increasing totalSupply).
 * - burn / burnFrom: destroy tokens (decreasing balances and totalSupply).
 *
 * NAMING:
 * - name and symbol are set in the constructor.
 * - decimals is a constant 18 (like ETH), so 1 token = 10^18 "smallest units".
