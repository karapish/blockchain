Notes & Trade-offs (Proxy Patterns)
Transparent Proxy
•	Pros: Clear admin vs user separation; battle-tested, widely supported.
•	Cons: Slightly higher call gas—admin checks on every call; upgrade logic lives in proxy.  ￼

UUPS (ERC-1822)
•	Pros: Lighter proxy (lower call gas); upgrade logic in implementation; OZ (openzeppelin) tooling supports it.
•	Cons: If upgrade auth/logic is buggy, you can brick upgrades; requires careful controls.  ￼

Beacon Proxy
•	Pros: One upgrade for many proxies (great for factories/clones).
•	Cons: Centralized beacon risk; each call reads beacon → small extra overhead.  ￼

Diamond (EIP-2535)
•	Pros: Modular facets; bypass single-contract size limits; selective upgrades.
•	Cons: Highest complexity; storage layout & audit surface are bigger.  ￼

Recommendations — When to Use What
•	Single upgradable app, cost-sensitive calls: use UUPS (lean proxy; implementation controls upgrades).  ￼
•	Safety/clarity over gas (e.g., high-value DeFi): use Transparent (very mature, explicit admin path).  ￼
•	Many similar instances (vaults, tokens) needing synchronized upgrades: use Beacon.  ￼
•	Large, modular systems that hit size limits or need facetized ownership/permissions: use Diamond.  ￼

Rule of thumb: 
Start with UUPS unless you need multi-instance upgrades (Beacon) or extreme modularity/size (Diamond); 
choose Transparent if you want the simplest, most familiar security posture for admins.
