# ERC-20 Ownable Token with Mint & Burn

## Overview

This smart contract implements a fungible token with:

- Full ERC-20 standard interface (EIP-20)
- Ownership control (via `Ownable`)
- Minting (only owner can mint new tokens)
- Burning (token holders or approved spenders can burn tokens)

---

## Specification

### Interfaces & Behavior

| Component | Methods / Events | Access Control / Requirements |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| **ERC-20** | `totalSupply()`, `balanceOf(address)`, `transfer(address,uint256)`, `approve(address,uint256)`, `transferFrom(address,address,uint256)`, `allowance(address,uint256)` <br> Events: `Transfer`, `Approval` | Standard checks: non‚Äêzero addresses, sufficient balances, allowance logic, etc. |
| **Ownable** | `owner()`, `onlyOwner` modifier, `transferOwnership(address)`, optionally `renounceOwnership()` | Owner set at deployment; only owner can call owner-only functions. |
| **Minting** | `mint(address to, uint256 amount)` | Only owner can mint; cannot mint to zero address; total supply increases. |
| **Burning** | `burn(uint256 amount)`, `burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount)` | Holders (or approved spender) can burn; sufficient balance; total supply decreases. |

---

## Security & Constraints

- Prevent operations involving zero address.
- Ensure safe arithmetic (overflow/underflow) ‚Äî use Solidity ‚â•0.8 or libraries.
- Emit appropriate events: for `mint`, a `Transfer(0x0, to, amount)`; for `burn`, `Transfer(account, 0x0, amount)`.
- Ownership functions protected via `onlyOwner`.
- Do not allow minting/burning beyond expected logical constraints (if any).

---

## Out of Scope

Unless added explicitly, the contract **does not include**:

- Role-based access beyond single owner (e.g. separate minters or burners)
- Supply cap / maximum supply
- Pausing or freezing transfers
- Permit / meta-transaction support
- Snapshot / voting / staking or other extensions

---

## Who Pays Gas When You Invoke a Non-View Function via MetaMask

1. You send a transaction (non-view function call) through MetaMask.
2. **You** (the sender) pay for the gas.
3. The payment comes from your wallet address (the account you used in MetaMask).
4. MetaMask will show you an estimate for the gas cost before you confirm.
5. If your wallet doesn‚Äôt have enough ETH to cover the gas, the transaction will fail or won‚Äôt be sent.

---

## üîç Additional Details

- Gas cost = `gasUsed √ó gasPrice` (or with EIP-1559: base fee + priority tip).
- Even if the transaction fails (e.g. reverts), you still pay gas for the work done up until the failure.
- The recipient of a transaction doesn‚Äôt pay the gas. The gas always comes from the sender (unless some contract logic reimburses them later, but that‚Äôs extra).  


Here‚Äôs a walkthrough (in Markdown) of the Ethereum send() / transaction signing & lifecycle process, covering who signs what, what RPC does, validation, rejection, etc.

‚∏ª


# Ethereum Transaction Send / Signing Lifecycle

Below is a step-by-step of what happens when you invoke a non-view function (via `send()`), from signing to inclusion in a block.

---

## 1. What parties sign

- **Externally Owned Account (EOA)**: the user who owns the private key of the sending address signs the transaction.
- **No other party signs** by default. Only the private key of the sender is used to generate a digital signature over the transaction contents (nonce, gas limit, gas price / tip, to, value, data, chain ID).  [oai_citation:0‚Ä°Medium](https://medium.com/mycrypto/the-magic-of-digital-signatures-on-ethereum-98fe184dc9c7?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- If using a wallet such as MetaMask, the wallet UI will ask you to confirm, then uses your private key (or hardware wallet) to sign.

---

## 2. Will RPC be invoked?

- After signing **locally**, the signed transaction is sent (broadcast) to the Ethereum network via an RPC endpoint (e.g. via `eth_sendRawTransaction`) or via a provider (like Infura, Alchemy, or your own node).  [oai_citation:1‚Ä°Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/how-ethereum-transactions-work?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- The local client (wallet / Web3 library) constructs the transaction object, signs it, serializes it (often RLP encoding), then invokes an RPC call to submit the signed transaction.  [oai_citation:2‚Ä°Medium](https://medium.com/mycrypto/the-magic-of-digital-signatures-on-ethereum-98fe184dc9c7?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

## 3. What party is accountable for validation and rejection

- **Sender / wallet**: ensures correct parameters (e.g. nonce, gas limit, to address, data) before signing. If something is invalid, the client/wallet may reject locally (e.g. bad address, insufficient funds).
- **RPC node / Ethereum node/network**: once submitted, the node that receives the transaction validates it. Validation includes checks like:
  - Is signature valid?
  - Is the nonce correct (not replaying or too low)?
  - Does the sender have enough ETH for gas + value?
  - Is gas price acceptable?
  - Is chainId correct?
- If any validation fails, the transaction is rejected (not included in the mempool). The node may reply with an error.

---

## 4. Lifecycle of the transaction (if it passes initial validation)

1. **Mempool / Transaction Pool**
  - After passing basic checks, the transaction sits in the node‚Äôs transaction pool (mempool) waiting to be picked up by a miner (or validator, depending on consensus).

2. **Mining / Including in Block**
  - A miner/validator picks the transaction (often based on gas price / tip) and includes it in a new block.

3. **Block Propagation**
  - The block is propagated to other nodes.

4. **State Execution**
  - When the block is executed, the transaction executes the specified function on contract (non-view), updating state. Gas is consumed.

5. **Receipt**
  - A transaction receipt is generated, containing status (success/failure), gas used, logs/events, etc.

6. **Confirmation**
  - Once the block is part of the canonical chain and many more blocks are built on top, the transaction is considered confirmed.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

- The **sender** signs with their private key.
- RPC is invoked to submit the signed transaction.
- Nodes validate and can reject if invalid.
- If valid, the tx enters the mempool, then eventually included in a block, executed, and you get a receipt.

---

‚úÖ **How to determine the correct nonce**

You generally fetch the nonce by querying the network for the account‚Äôs transaction count. Key options:

- **Using RPC / provider**:  
  Call `eth_getTransactionCount(address, "pending")` ‚Äî this returns confirmed + pending transactions (so you can safely use the next nonce).

- **Alternative**:  
  Call `eth_getTransactionCount(address, "latest")` (only confirmed ones), but this may cause collisions if you have pending txs.

---

‚ö†Ô∏è **What to watch out for**

- **Pending transactions**:  
  If you already submitted txs that aren‚Äôt mined, their nonces are reserved. Using the same nonce will cause conflicts or rejection.

- **Skipping nonces**:  
  If you pick a nonce higher than current + 1 (leaving gaps), that tx stays pending until all prior nonces are mined. Later txs are blocked until gaps are filled.

- **Concurrency**:  
  If multiple processes/wallets send txs from the same address, they may race for nonces. Use shared state or locking to avoid clashes.

---

üõ† **Best practices**

- Always query `"pending"` nonce from your provider before creating a tx.
- If you have a queue of txs, track nonces locally so you know what‚Äôs reserved even if not confirmed.
- If a tx is stuck or pending too long, replace it by submitting a new tx with the same nonce but higher gas (**replace-by-fee**).
- Use libraries / SDKs / frameworks that help with nonce management (e.g. **ethers.js**, **web3.js**, **Nethereum**, or backend systems) to avoid manual handling.  

### SDKs
- ethers.js
- web3.js
- Nethereum

When you send a transaction to a node (RPC / full node), it goes through several validation steps **before** being accepted into the node‚Äôs mempool. These checks help ensure that bad/fraudulent transactions are filtered out.

Here are key checks / steps:

| Step                  | What is Checked                                                                                   | Why It Protects                                                  |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Signature correctness** | The transaction must have a valid digital signature matching the claimed sender address.          | Prevents spoofing / forging of transactions.                     |
| **Nonce correctness**     | The nonce must be ‚â• the account‚Äôs current nonce; usually from `eth_getTransactionCount(..., "pending")`. | Avoids replay or out-of-order or duplicate tx issues.            |
| **Balance check**         | Sender must have enough ETH to cover `value + gas limit √ó gas price` (or max fees).                | Prevents transactions that would overspend.                      |
| **Gas limit & fees**      | Gas limit must be valid; fees must meet minimal rules, etc. If gas price is too low, some nodes may decline or drop. | Prevents spam / DoS with extremely underpriced txs.               |
| **Basic format checks**   | RLP-serialization correctness; fields present; chain ID matching; etc.                           | Ensures malformed txs are rejected early.                        |
| **Consensus rules**       | The tx must not violate protocol or client-specific rules (e.g. EIP rules, gas rules, chain rules). | Prevents invalid state transitions.                              |

---

‚úÖ **Transaction Flow & Types**

- Only valid transactions enter your node‚Äôs mempool and get broadcast.
- Other nodes revalidate them during propagation.

---

üîπ **Types of Ethereum transactions**
- **Contract deployment**
- **Human-to-human (EOA ‚Üí EOA)**
- **Contract-to-contract (internal)**
- **Hybrid (e.g., DeFi use)**

---

üîπ **Transaction states**
- **Pooled / Mined / Dropped / Replaced**
- **Canceled** ‚Äì replacement that cancels the original
- **Confirmed** ‚Äì mined & included on-chain
- **EOA** ‚Äì between Externally Owned Accounts
- **Failed** ‚Äì attempted but didn‚Äôt succeed
- **Internal** ‚Äì smart contract ‚Üî smart contract
- **Private** ‚Äì sent directly to a miner (skip mempool)
- **Stuck** ‚Äì pending, can‚Äôt be mined
- **Type 0** ‚Äì legacy (pre-EIP-1559)
- **Type 2** ‚Äì EIP-1559 format  

### üîå Ethereum Wire Protocol: Full Node Tasks

All full nodes on Ethereum have three basic tasks with the **Wire protocol**:

1. **Synchronization** ‚Äì Download and verify headers, blocks, and state to stay in sync.
2. **Block Propagation** ‚Äì Share new blocks with peers for fast global consensus.
3. **Pending Transaction Propagation** ‚Äì Gossip unconfirmed transactions from mempool to peers.  

Ethereum transactions are propagated across a decentralized Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network using protocols like RLPx and the Wire Protocol, ensuring block producers and validators can find pending transactions in the mempool. Nodes discover each other using bootnodes and establish secure connections using the RPLx protocol. They synchronize state, blocks, and pooled transactions using the Wire protocol

Nodes propagate transactions by signaling new transactions via the NewPooledTransactionHashes message, or peers can query for these transactions using the GetPooledTransactions message. Since The Merge, the consensus layer client receives, pre-validates, and passes blocks to the execution layer client, which executes transactions, validates the block‚Äôs state, and sends the validated block back to the consensus layer client for broadcasting. 


### Our actors in Ethereum‚Äôs transaction flow

---

‚ö° **Front-running bots**
- Monitor the public mempool for profitable opportunities.
- When they see a big trade, they send their own tx with higher gas so it executes first.
- Example: You buy a token ‚Üí bot buys before you ‚Üí raises price ‚Üí sells after (sandwich attack).

---

üìä **MEV searchers**
- MEV = *Maximal Extractable Value*.
- More advanced than simple bots: scan mempool or use private relays (e.g., Flashbots).
- Bundle profitable txs (arbitrage, liquidations, sandwiching) ‚Üí submit to validators.
- Compete in an ‚ÄúMEV auction‚Äù by paying higher fees.

---

üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è **Validators**
- Block proposers in Ethereum Proof-of-Stake.
- Decide which mempool txs (public/private) to include in blocks.
- Profit motive: maximize rewards via priority fees + MEV bundles.
- Can cooperate with searchers via MEV relays (e.g., Flashbots).

---

üîç **Explorers**
- Tools like Etherscan to observe mempool and chain state.
- Show pending txs, gas prices, activity.
- Don‚Äôt seek profit directly but provide transparency that bots/searchers also use.

---

‚úÖ **In short:**
- Front-running bots = simple opportunists.
- MEV searchers = advanced profit optimizers.
- Validators = decide final tx ordering/inclusion.
- Explorers = observers giving visibility.  

### Ethereum Transaction Types & EIP-1559
- Type 0 (Legacy): Transaction format from before EIP-1559. Uses a single `gasPrice` field. Still valid and accepted.
- Type 2 (EIP-1559): Introduced in the London hard fork. Uses `maxFeePerGas` + `maxPriorityFeePerGas` + base fee mechanics. Default/preferred now.
- Backwards compatibility: Legacy transactions continue to work even after EIP-1559. 

### üîπ Full Node
- Stores full blockchain data (headers, blocks, state).
- Verifies all transactions and blocks against consensus rules.
- Relays valid txs/blocks across the p2p network.
- Does **not** create new blocks.

### üîπ Miner (Proof-of-Work era, pre-Merge)
- A full node **plus** block production role.
- Used computational power (hashing) to solve puzzles.
- If successful, produced a block ‚Üí earned block reward + fees.

### üîπ Validator (Proof-of-Stake, post-Merge)
- A full node **plus** staking-based block proposer role.
- Selected randomly (weighted by stake) to propose/attest blocks.
- Earns rewards from priority fees, MEV, and issuance.

‚úÖ In short:
- **Full node** = verifies & relays.
- **Miner (old)** / **Validator (current)** = full node + *block producer* role.  


### üîπ How MEV Searchers Operate

1. **Transaction Monitoring**
  - Run their own Ethereum nodes or use private relay feeds.
  - Continuously scan pending txs in the public mempool.
  - Identify profitable patterns: arbitrage, liquidations, sandwich opportunities.

2. **Simulation**
  - Use custom bots to simulate ‚Äúwhat if I insert my tx here?‚Äù
  - Run many simulations to estimate profit vs. cost (gas, risk).

3. **Bundling & Submission**
  - Craft bundles of transactions (their tx + victim tx + closing tx).
  - Submit via:
    - Public mempool (fast, higher gas to outbid others).
    - Private relays (e.g. **Flashbots**) ‚Üí avoid leaking strategy to bots.

4. **Competition**
  - Multiple searchers compete in a ‚ÄúMEV auction.‚Äù
  - Offer higher **priority fees** or direct payments to validators.
  - Validator includes the most profitable bundle.

5. **Execution**
  - If chosen, their transactions execute in the exact order they planned.
  - Profit goes to the searcher; validator earns the tip.

---

### üîπ Community & Communication
- **Searchers are organized** and often work semi-professionally.
- Public discussion happens in research forums (e.g., [Flashbots forum](https://collective.flashbots.net/)).
- Academic papers, GitHub repos, and blogs explain MEV strategies in theory.
- Anything like ‚Äúspecial Discord channels‚Äù does exist, but they are **private, competitive, and not open to the public** ‚Äî most professional MEV actors guard strategies closely.

‚úÖ In short:  
MEV searchers are like **quant traders for Ethereum** ‚Üí scanning txs, simulating outcomes, and competing to pay validators for profitable order flow.  


### üîπ Private Relays in Ethereum

- **What they are**
  - Network services that let MEV searchers send transaction bundles **directly to validators**, skipping the public mempool.
  - Part of the *MEV-Boost* / PBS (Proposer-Builder Separation) ecosystem.

- **Why they exist**
  - Prevents strategies (arbitrage, liquidations, sandwiches) from being copied by other bots.
  - Reduces risk of front-running in the public mempool.
  - Lets validators earn more by receiving optimized bundles.

- **How they work**
  1. Searcher ‚Üí submits bundle to **builder** (via private relay).
  2. Builder ‚Üí constructs a block with most profitable tx ordering.
  3. Relay ‚Üí forwards block proposal to validator.
  4. Validator ‚Üí signs/attests block ‚Üí includes on chain.

- **Examples**
  - Flashbots Relay (most known).
  - bloXroute, Eden, Manifold, others.

‚úÖ In short:  
Private relays = **‚Äúprivate pipelines‚Äù** for transactions, used to protect MEV strategies and let validators choose the most profitable block proposals.

### üîπ Base Staking Yield (Inflation-Only)

- **Where it comes from**
  - Ethereum issues new ETH as rewards to validators for duties:
    - Attestations (voting on correct blocks)
    - Sync committee participation
    - Proposing blocks

- **Rate depends on validator count**
  - The more validators there are, the more the total reward pool is split.
  - Each validator gets a smaller slice when participation grows.

- **Typical range**
  - With current validator set (~1M+ active validators), base inflation rewards = ~3‚Äì4% APR.
  - This excludes **execution-layer rewards** (priority fees + MEV).

- **Key point**
  - Inflation yield is the *guaranteed, protocol-level* reward.
  - Execution rewards (fees, MEV) sit **on top** and push APR higher (‚âà5‚Äì6% with MEV-Boost).  


### üîπ Why Ethereum Blockspace Feels Scarce

1. **Bidding wars**
  - Open mempool = everyone competes on gas price.
  - Creates volatility, higher fees, and disadvantages for regular users.

2. **All-pay auction problem**
  - Even failed bids consume blockspace (reverted txs still included).
  - Bidders underprice to reduce risk, lowering validator revenue.
  - Artificial scarcity emerges.

3. **Limited bidding language**
  - `gasPrice` (Type 0) or simple fee bidding doesn‚Äôt allow fine ordering preferences.
  - Users resort to spamming or brute-force strategies.
  - Wastes blockspace and adds network load.

‚úÖ In short: Blockspace is scarce not just because of technical limits, but also due to **inefficient auction design** in the public mempool.  

### üîπ Execution vs. Consensus Clients
- **Execution client (e.g., Geth, Nethermind)**
  - Runs the EVM, processes transactions, updates balances and state.

- **Consensus client (beacon node, e.g., Prysm, Lighthouse)**
  - Runs Proof-of-Stake consensus.
  - Relies on the execution client for transaction validity and state.

---

### üîπ When a block has a failed transaction
- The **execution payload** in the block contains all transactions.
- Execution client applies them sequentially:
  - **Reverted tx** ‚Üí sender loses gas, no other state changes.
  - **Successful tx** ‚Üí balances and contracts updated.

---

### üîπ How the beacon node learns
1. Beacon node receives the new block from the proposer.
2. Forwards the **execution payload** to its paired execution client.
3. Execution client updates balances and state.
4. Beacon node checks that the resulting state matches the block‚Äôs root.

---

‚úÖ **In short:**
- The **execution client** updates wallet balances.
- The **beacon node** only coordinates consensus and validates that the execution client‚Äôs result is correct.  


### üîπ Ethereum‚Äôs Account Model
- Ethereum uses an **account-based model** (not UTXO like Bitcoin).
- Each account has:
  - **Address**
  - **Nonce**
  - **Balance**
  - **Storage root** (for contracts)
  - **Code hash** (for contracts)

---

### üîπ World State
- The EL client maintains a global **world state** = mapping of all accounts ‚Üí their balances and data.
- This state is stored in a **Merkle Patricia Trie (state trie)**.
- Root hash of the trie is included in every block header.

---

### üîπ Syncing
- When you run an EL client:
  - It downloads blocks from peers.
  - Applies all transactions in order.
  - Updates the state trie after each block.
- Over time, the client reconstructs the **entire Ethereum state**.

---

### üîπ Wallet visibility
- The client doesn‚Äôt need to ‚Äútrack‚Äù wallets individually.
- It just stores the entire state database (key-value store).
- If you query `eth_getBalance(address)`, the client looks up that address in its state trie.

---

‚úÖ **In short:**  
An EL client ‚Äúknows all wallets‚Äù because it maintains the **entire Ethereum state trie**, updated with every block. Every balance, nonce, and contract is part of this global state, not something the client has to ‚Äúdiscover‚Äù one by one.  


### üîπ Ethereum (ETH)
- **State storage:** Merkle Patricia Trie (MPT) ‚Üí maps addresses ‚Üí accounts (balance, nonce, storage, code).
- **Persistence:** Entire state is maintained *continuously* and updated with every block.
- **Size:** As of 2025, the Ethereum world state is hundreds of GBs (‚âà250‚Äì350 GB depending on pruning).
- **Lifetime:** Indefinite ‚Äî state persists as long as accounts/contracts exist.

---

### üîπ Ethereum Classic (ETC)
- **Same design as Ethereum** (before upgrades like Verkle tries are introduced).
- Uses the Merkle Patricia Trie for global state.
- **Size:** A bit smaller than ETH because of less activity and fewer contracts.
- **Lifetime:** Also indefinite ‚Äî state grows with chain usage.

---

### üîπ Bitcoin (BTC)
- **Different model:** UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) set.
- No account trie ‚Äî instead, it tracks all unspent outputs in a database (LevelDB/RocksDB).
- **Persistence:** UTXO set is updated every block, like Ethereum‚Äôs state.
- **Size:** Much smaller ‚Äî ~10‚Äì15 GB today (since it only tracks spendable outputs, not contracts/storage).
- **Lifetime:** Indefinite, updated as long as Bitcoin runs.

---

‚úÖ **In short:**
- ETH & ETC ‚Üí use a **Merkle Patricia Trie** to store the full account-based world state, continuously updated, and now hundreds of GB in size.
- BTC ‚Üí uses a **UTXO set** instead, stored in a database, smaller (~10‚Äì15 GB).
- In all cases, this state is kept *forever*, updated at each block, because it‚Äôs the reference for validating new transactions.  


### üîπ Ethereum / Ethereum Classic State Model

- **Accounts:**  
  Two types:
  1. **Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs):** normal wallets (just balance + nonce).
  2. **Contract Accounts:** smart contracts (balance + code + *storage*).

- **Storage:**
  - Each contract account has its own persistent key-value store.
  - This storage is part of the world state, kept in the Merkle Patricia Trie.
  - Keys/values are 32-byte slots.

---

### üîπ Solidity Example (your array case)
```solidity
uint256[] public myArray;
```
### üîπ Storage Mapping in Solidity

- **`myArray.length`** ‚Üí stored at a fixed slot.  
- **Elements (`myArray[0]`, `myArray[1]`, ‚Ä¶)** ‚Üí stored at derived slots (using `keccak256` hashing).  

When your contract runs, the **EVM reads/writes** these slots in the account‚Äôs storage.  

---

### üîπ Key Point
- **Yes:** In Ethereum/ETC, ‚Äústorage‚Äù is the persistent data space inside **contract accounts**.  
- **EOAs (human wallets):** no contract storage, only **balance + nonce**.  
- All of this lives inside the global **state trie**, so every node can validate and reproduce the same results.  

---

‚úÖ **In short:**  
Arrays, mappings, and structs in Solidity ‚Üí compiled into **storage slots** ‚Üí stored in the contract account ‚Üí persisted in the **state trie**.  

### üîπ Coinbase Accounts

- **User accounts at Coinbase**
  - When you open a Coinbase account, they create a **custodial wallet** for you.
  - On-chain, this corresponds to an **Externally Owned Account (EOA)** controlled by Coinbase‚Äôs infrastructure, not directly by you.
  - Coinbase holds the private keys, you just interact via their app/API.

- **Contract accounts**
  - Coinbase doesn‚Äôt create contract accounts for you by default.
  - If you deploy a smart contract, *you* (or your app) would create that account on Ethereum, not Coinbase.

---

‚úÖ **In short:**  
Coinbase user wallets are **EOAs**. They‚Äôre custodial EOAs, meaning Coinbase holds the keys. Contract accounts are separate and created only when you deploy smart contracts.  

### üîπ MetaMask Accounts

- **EOAs only**
  - MetaMask generates **Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs)** for users.
  - You control these via your private key or seed phrase.
  - These EOAs can hold ETH/tokens, sign txs, and interact with smart contracts.

- **Contract accounts**
  - MetaMask does **not** create contract accounts automatically.
  - If you deploy a smart contract using MetaMask, *that action* creates a new **contract account** on Ethereum.
  - But the creation comes from your EOA sending a deployment transaction.

---

‚úÖ **In short:**  
MetaMask = wallet for **EOAs**.  
Contract accounts exist only if you **deploy a contract** from your EOA.  

### üîπ Create an Externally Owned Account (EOA)
- EOAs are just a **keypair** (private key + address).
- They are **not created on-chain** until they send or receive ETH/tokens.
- Typical API calls:
  - **web3.js / ethers.js**
    ```js
    // web3.js
    const account = web3.eth.accounts.create();
    console.log(account.address, account.privateKey);
    ```
    ```js
    // ethers.js
    const wallet = ethers.Wallet.createRandom();
    console.log(wallet.address, wallet.privateKey);
    ```
  - **JSON-RPC**
    - `personal_newAccount` (if node has the personal API enabled)

---

### üîπ Create a Contract Account
- Contract accounts are created **on-chain** when an EOA sends a special transaction with `data` = compiled bytecode.
- Typical API calls:
  - **JSON-RPC**
    - `eth_sendTransaction` with a `data` field (no `to` address)
    ```json
    {
      "from": "0xYourEOA",
      "data": "0x6080604052...",   // contract bytecode
      "gas": "0x500000"
    }
    ```
  - **web3.js / ethers.js**
    ```js
    const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi);
    contract.deploy({ data: bytecode })
      .send({ from: account, gas: 5000000 });
    ```
    ```js
    const factory = new ethers.ContractFactory(abi, bytecode, wallet);
    const contract = await factory.deploy();
    ```

---

‚úÖ **In short:**
- **EOA = keypair** ‚Üí created locally via libraries (`accounts.create`, `Wallet.createRandom`, etc.), no transaction required.
- **Contract account = deployed contract** ‚Üí created on-chain via `eth_sendTransaction` with `data = bytecode`.  


### üîπ EOAs and the Ledger
- An **EOA is just a keypair** (address + private key).
- When you generate it locally (MetaMask, ethers.js, Coinbase internal systems), it doesn‚Äôt yet exist *on-chain*.
- The Ethereum ledger doesn‚Äôt pre-store ‚Äúall possible addresses.‚Äù

---

### üîπ How it receives assets
- Ethereum‚Äôs **world state** (state trie) is a mapping: `address ‚Üí account data`.
- If an address has **never been used**, it simply isn‚Äôt present in the state trie.
- The **moment someone sends ETH/tokens to it**, the EL client:
  - Creates a new entry in the state trie for that address.
  - Initializes it with balance (and nonce = 0).

---

### üîπ Key Point
- You don‚Äôt need to ‚Äúregister‚Äù an EOA on-chain before receiving assets.
- The address is deterministically derived from your keypair, so anyone can send to it.
- The ledger will ‚Äúactivate‚Äù the account when a transaction or transfer first touches it.

---

‚úÖ **In short:**  
An EOA is ‚Äúoff-chain‚Äù until first use. Once ETH or a token is sent to it, the execution client creates an entry for it in the global state, and from then on, it‚Äôs part of the ledger.  

### üîπ How Ethereum Addresses Are Derived

1. **Private key**
  - A random 256-bit number.
  - Must remain secret (controls the account).

2. **Public key**
  - Derived from the private key using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (secp256k1).
  - One-to-one relationship: every private key produces exactly one public key.

3. **Address**
  - Take the public key.
  - Hash it with `keccak256`.
  - Take the **last 20 bytes** ‚Üí that‚Äôs your Ethereum address.
  - Example:
    ```
    address = keccak256(public_key)[12:]
    ```

---

### üîπ Why it‚Äôs deterministic
- Given the same private key ‚Üí always get the same public key ‚Üí always get the same address.
- No central registry is needed.
- That‚Äôs why wallets like MetaMask or Coinbase can generate addresses offline and know they‚Äôll work.

---

### üîπ How others can send to it
- Once you know the address, you don‚Äôt need the private key to send assets there.
- Anyone can include that address in a transaction‚Äôs `to` field.
- When the first transfer happens, Ethereum clients add the address to the global state with its new balance.

---

‚úÖ **In short:**  
An Ethereum address is just a deterministic hash of a keypair. Because it‚Äôs predictable and unique, it can receive ETH or tokens *even before it appears on-chain*.  

### üîπ Block arrives
- The EL client receives a new block (with its transactions) from peers.
- Each transaction has a `from`, `to`, `value`, `gas`, and optional `data`.

---

### üîπ Processing transactions
- For each tx, the client:
  1. **Checks sender (`from`)**
    - The account *must* already exist in the state trie (otherwise tx is invalid).
  2. **Checks recipient (`to`)**
    - If `to` exists ‚Üí update its balance / run contract code.
    - If `to` does **not** exist and it‚Äôs not empty code ‚Üí create a new account entry in the state trie.
      - Example: first time you send ETH to a fresh EOA.

---

### üîπ Updating the global state trie
- If an address didn‚Äôt exist in the trie yet:
  - The client inserts a new entry (`balance = value`, `nonce = 0`, `code = empty`, `storage = empty`).
- The state root is recalculated after applying all transactions in the block.
- The block header includes this **new state root**, which every node checks to stay in sync.

---

### üîπ Key Point
- EL clients don‚Äôt ‚Äúpre-know‚Äù all addresses.
- They **dynamically add them** to the state trie the first time a tx touches them.
- That‚Äôs how a never-before-used EOA can suddenly hold ETH after its first incoming transfer.

‚úÖ **In short:**  
When a block arrives, the EL client processes txs ‚Üí if a `to` address isn‚Äôt in the trie yet, it **creates it on the fly** and updates the state accordingly.  


### üîπ Why an EOA address is unique and deterministic
- **1 private key ‚Üí 1 public key ‚Üí 1 address**
  - Private key: random 256-bit number.
  - Public key: derived from private key using elliptic curve multiplication (secp256k1).
  - Address: `address = keccak256(public_key)[12:]` ‚Üí last 20 bytes.

---

### üîπ Key implications
- **Deterministic:** Same private key always yields the same address.
- **Unique:** The probability of two private keys giving the same address is astronomically small.
- **Trustless:** Anyone can generate an address offline, no central registry needed.
- **Receivable:** Others only need the 20-byte address, not the public or private key, to send ETH/tokens.

---

‚úÖ **In short:**  
An EOA works because cryptography guarantees a *1-to-1 deterministic mapping* from private key ‚Üí public key ‚Üí address. That‚Äôs why an address can exist ‚Äúoff-chain‚Äù and still receive assets the first time it‚Äôs referenced in a block.  

### üîπ Private Key
- A 256-bit secret number ‚Äî must be kept hidden.
- **Used for:**
  - **Signing transactions** (ECDSA signatures).
  - Proving ownership of the account (you control the funds).
- Never shared; only the signature is broadcast.

---

### üîπ Public Key
- Derived from the private key (via secp256k1 elliptic curve multiplication).
- **Used for:**
  - **Verifying signatures** ‚Üí nodes confirm that a tx was signed by the right private key.
  - **Deriving the address** ‚Üí `keccak256(public_key)[12:]`.
- Doesn‚Äôt need to be kept secret; anyone can know it.

---

### üîπ Address
- Derived from the public key.
- **Used for:**
  - Receiving ETH/tokens.
  - Identifying accounts on-chain.
- Much shorter (20 bytes) so easier to handle than raw public keys.

---

‚úÖ **In short:**
- **Private key = sign.**
- **Public key = verify.**
- **Address = receive.**  


### üîπ Public Key
- **What it is:**
  - Mathematically derived from the private key (via elliptic curve multiplication).
  - A fixed identifier that corresponds to one private key.

- **Purpose:**
  - Used to **verify** signatures created with the private key.
  - Used to derive your **address** (`keccak256(public_key)[12:]`).

- **Properties:**
  - Can be shared openly.
  - Same every time (doesn‚Äôt change).

---

### üîπ Signature
- **What it is:**
  - A cryptographic proof generated by applying the private key to some message (e.g., a transaction).
  - In Ethereum, this is an **ECDSA signature** (r, s, v values).

- **Purpose:**
  - Proves that the message/transaction came from the holder of the private key.
  - Allows others to check validity using only the public key.

- **Properties:**
  - Different every time, even if the same message is signed (because of randomization in the algorithm).
  - Only valid for the specific message signed.

---

‚úÖ **In short:**
- **Public key** = a *static identifier* derived from the private key, used for verification.
- **Signature** = a *dynamic proof* generated with the private key, used to show authenticity of a specific message.  

### üîπ Step 1 ‚Äî You create the transaction
- You fill in:
  - `to` = your friend‚Äôs address
  - `value` = 1 ETH
  - `gas` + `maxFeePerGas`
- This unsigned transaction is just a piece of data.

---

### üîπ Step 2 ‚Äî MetaMask uses your private key
- MetaMask holds your **private key** (in the browser extension, encrypted with your password).
- It takes the unsigned tx data and runs **ECDSA signing** with your private key.
- Output = transaction + **signature (r, s, v)**.
- The private key **never leaves MetaMask**.

---

### üîπ Step 3 ‚Äî Transaction broadcast
- The signed transaction is sent to your connected **Execution Layer (EL) client** (e.g., Infura, Alchemy, or your own Geth).
- The client gossips it across the Ethereum p2p network (devp2p ‚Üí eth/66 protocol).

---

### üîπ Step 4 ‚Äî How the EL verifies
When another EL client receives the tx:
1. **Recover public key** from the signature (possible because ECDSA allows key recovery).
2. Hash public key with `keccak256`, take last 20 bytes ‚Üí reconstruct the **sender address**.
3. Check:
  - Does the sender exist in the state trie?
  - Does the sender have ‚â• 1 ETH + gas fees?
  - Is the nonce correct?
  - Is the signature valid?

If all checks pass ‚Üí tx is valid and goes to the mempool.

---

### üîπ Step 5 ‚Äî Block inclusion
- A validator eventually proposes a block.
- The EL executes your tx:
  - Deducts 1 ETH + gas from **your EOA balance**.
  - Increments your nonce.
  - Adds 1 ETH to your friend‚Äôs account (creating it in the trie if it didn‚Äôt exist yet).

---

‚úÖ **In short:**
- **Private key**: signs the tx (in MetaMask).
- **Signature**: proves authenticity, lets EL recover your public key/address.
- **Public key**: never sent directly, only reconstructed from the signature.
- **Execution client**: verifies signature + state, then updates balances when block is mined.  

### üîπ 1. Proposer is chosen
- In Proof-of-Stake, the **beacon chain (Consensus Layer)** randomly selects a validator to propose the next block.
- That validator runs *both*:
  - A **Consensus Layer (CL) client** (e.g., Lighthouse, Prysm).
  - An **Execution Layer (EL) client** (e.g., Geth, Nethermind).

---

### üîπ 2. EL prepares the payload
- The validator‚Äôs **EL client** takes pending transactions from its **mempool**.
- It executes them in order, applying gas limits and validity checks.
- Result = **execution payload**:
  - List of transactions
  - Resulting state root
  - Receipts, logs, etc.

---

### üîπ 3. Handshake between EL and CL
- The **EL client** passes this execution payload to the validator‚Äôs **CL client** through the **Engine API** (`engine_getPayload`, `engine_newPayload`, etc.).
- CL client doesn‚Äôt execute txs ‚Äî it just trusts EL for state.

---

### üîπ 4. Block is proposed
- The validator‚Äôs **CL client** wraps the execution payload into a beacon block.
- Broadcasts the block to other validators on the P2P network.

---

### üîπ 5. Other validators verify
- Peers‚Äô **EL clients** re-execute the payload transactions to confirm the state root.
- Their **CL clients** check consensus rules (signatures, attestations).
- If all checks pass ‚Üí block accepted.

---

‚úÖ **In short:**
- The EL client *inside the validator‚Äôs own node* feeds transactions ‚Üí execution payload ‚Üí to the CL client.
- The CL client ‚Üí proposes the block to the rest of the network.
- So the tx doesn‚Äôt ‚Äútravel‚Äù to some remote staker ‚Äî the validator *is* running EL+CL together.  

### üîπ Normal flow (no MEV-Boost)
- Each validator runs its own **EL client** with a mempool.
- When selected to propose a block, it picks txs from *its own mempool* to build the block.

---

### üîπ With MEV-Boost
- Validators **outsource block building** to external **block builders**.
- Flow:
  1. Searchers ‚Üí send bundles of profitable txs to builders.
  2. Builders ‚Üí construct candidate full blocks (using their own mempool + bundles).
  3. Builders ‚Üí submit bids via **relays** to validators.
  4. Validator (via MEV-Boost middleware) ‚Üí chooses the most profitable block proposal.

- The validator‚Äôs own EL client doesn‚Äôt build the block in this case ‚Äî it just verifies the block is valid after the builder provides it.

---

### üîπ Key point
- MEV-Boost **does not send txs directly into a validator‚Äôs mempool**.
- Instead, it bypasses the validator‚Äôs mempool entirely by letting **builders deliver ready-made blocks**.
- Validators pick between blocks (auctions), not transactions.

---

‚úÖ **In short:**
- **Without MEV-Boost**: Validator‚Äôs mempool ‚Üí block.
- **With MEV-Boost**: Builder‚Äôs mempool/bundles ‚Üí block ‚Üí validator.  


### üîπ Execution Payload (simplified structure)

- **parentHash** ‚Äì Hash of the parent execution block.
- **feeRecipient** ‚Äì Address that receives transaction fees (validator‚Äôs chosen withdrawal address).
- **stateRoot** ‚Äì Root of the state trie *after* applying all included transactions.
- **receiptsRoot** ‚Äì Root of the receipts trie (logs/events for each tx).
- **logsBloom** ‚Äì Bloom filter for quickly searching logs/events.
- **prevRandao** ‚Äì Randomness for the block (from beacon chain).
- **blockNumber** ‚Äì Height of the chain.
- **gasLimit / gasUsed** ‚Äì Gas constraints for the block.
- **timestamp** ‚Äì Unix time of the block.
- **baseFeePerGas** ‚Äì Base fee from EIP-1559.
- **extraData** ‚Äì Arbitrary data (set by proposer/builder).
- **transactions[]** ‚Äì The full list of signed txs included.
- **withdrawals[]** ‚Äì Withdrawals from validator balances (post-Shanghai/Capella).

---

### üîπ Example (simplified JSON)

```json
{
  "parentHash": "0xabc123...",
  "feeRecipient": "0xdef456...",
  "stateRoot": "0x789abc...",
  "receiptsRoot": "0x456def...",
  "logsBloom": "0x00...ff",

    "0xf87083..."
  ],

  ]
}
```

### üîπ Why miners went to Siberia
- PoW required massive energy, and electricity was the #1 cost.
- Regions with **cheap hydropower** (Siberia, Quebec, Iceland, parts of China) became mining hubs.
- Firms co-located their rigs near power stations to cut costs.

---

### üîπ What happened after The Merge
- Ethereum (ETH) abandoned PoW completely ‚Üí GPUs/ASICs for ETH became useless.
- Some miners tried to:
  - Switch to **Ethereum Classic (ETC)** or coins like **Ravencoin, Ergo**.
  - Repurpose GPUs for AI/ML workloads.
  - Sell hardware (big wave of used GPUs hit markets in 2022‚Äì23).
- Specialized ETH ASICs mostly became e-waste.

---

### üîπ Today
- The **ETH PoW mining business is gone**.
- Bitcoin mining still thrives ‚Äî and cheap electricity hubs are still relevant ‚Äî but BTC is mined with specialized ASICs, not GPUs.
- Those Siberian operations that were ETH-only either pivoted to BTC/ETC, sold off, or shut down.

---

‚úÖ **In short:**  
The ‚Äúcheap hydropower farm in Siberia‚Äù strategy worked in the PoW era. After Ethereum‚Äôs Merge, ETH mining ended, so that business disappeared ‚Äî only BTC and a few smaller PoW coins keep similar setups alive.  

### üîπ Example of Profitable Transactions to Builders
- **Arbitrage:**  
  Buy token on Uniswap at 100, sell on Sushiswap at 102 ‚Üí profit from price difference.
- **Liquidations:**  
  On Aave or Maker, liquidate an undercollateralized loan ‚Üí get a liquidation bonus.
- **Sandwich attack:**  
  Detect a large buy order in mempool ‚Üí place your buy just before, and sell just after, profiting from slippage.
- **Bundle:**  
  Searcher can package multiple txs together (buy + sell) to guarantee atomic profit if block includes both.

Builders receive these bundles and create blocks with maximum value for validators.

---

### üîπ Who is a Searcher?
- **Searcher = profit seeker.**
- They run bots to scan the mempool or private relays for opportunities.
- Use custom simulation engines to test ‚Äúwhat if my tx went here?‚Äù scenarios.
- Submit **bundles of profitable txs** to builders (via Flashbots or other relays).
- Compete against other searchers ‚Üí whoever pays the highest tips to validators usually wins.

---

‚úÖ **In short:**
- **Searcher = trader/algorithm/bot** that finds and bundles profitable opportunities.
- **Builder = block constructor** who takes txs (including from searchers) and assembles the most profitable block.
- Together they feed the MEV auction that validators pick from.  

### üîπ Collateralized Lending (Aave / Maker)
- User deposits collateral (e.g., 10 ETH) and borrows stablecoins (e.g., 10,000 DAI).
- Protocol requires a **collateral ratio** (e.g., 150%).

---

### üîπ When the loan goes underwater
- If ETH price drops, collateral may no longer meet the ratio.
- Example: 10 ETH @ $2,000 = $20,000 collateral ‚Üí ratio = 200%.
- If ETH falls to $1,200 ‚Üí $12,000 collateral, ratio = 120% (below 150%).
- Loan is now **undercollateralized**.

---

### üîπ Liquidation process
1. Protocol marks the position as liquidatable.
2. **Searcher (liquidator)** sends a liquidation transaction.
  - Repays part/all of the borrower‚Äôs debt on their behalf.
3. In return:
  - Liquidator seizes borrower‚Äôs collateral at a discount (e.g., 5‚Äì10%).
  - That discount = **liquidation bonus**, pure profit for the liquidator.

---

### üîπ Why it‚Äôs profitable
- Liquidators can instantly resell the collateral on DEXs.
- The ‚Äúbonus‚Äù ensures bots/searchers race to liquidate risky positions.

---

‚úÖ **In short:**  
Liquidations = buying collateral at a discount by paying off someone‚Äôs bad loan.  
Searchers/bots compete to grab these chances for a guaranteed profit.  

### üîπ Case: Liquidation on Aave / Maker
- Borrower‚Äôs position falls below collateral ratio.
- Liquidator repays the borrower‚Äôs debt (partially or fully).
- In return, liquidator gets the borrower‚Äôs collateral **+ a small bonus**.

---

### üîπ Does Aave/Maker lose money?
- **No, normally they don‚Äôt.**
  - The debt is repaid (by the liquidator).
  - The seized collateral covers the debt + the liquidation bonus.
  - Protocol remains solvent.

- **When risk appears:**
  - If the market moves **too fast** (e.g., ETH price crashes suddenly), collateral value might fall below debt + bonus.
  - In such cases, protocol‚Äôs insurance fund (e.g., Aave Safety Module, Maker‚Äôs Surplus Buffer) absorbs the shortfall.

---

### üîπ Who bears the loss?
- **Normal liquidation:** borrower loses collateral, liquidator profits, protocol safe.
- **Extreme crash:** protocol‚Äôs backstop funds or governance tokens (AAVE/MKR) may be used to cover deficit.

---

‚úÖ **In short:**
- In regular conditions ‚Üí **Aave/Maker do not lose money** in liquidations.
- In extreme volatility ‚Üí **losses are socialized** via insurance/backstop mechanisms.  


### üîπ Aave
- All core contracts (LendingPool, Incentives, Governance, etc.) are deployed on Ethereum.
- Source code is published and verified on **Etherscan**.
- Repo: [github.com/aave/protocol-v2](https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2) (and v3).
- Governance decisions (risk parameters, asset listings) are made by **AAVE token holders** through on-chain governance.

---

### üîπ MakerDAO
- Maker Protocol contracts (Vaults, Collateral, DAI Stablecoin, Liquidations) are also fully on-chain.
- Verified on **Etherscan**.
- Repo: [github.com/makerdao](https://github.com/makerdao).
- Governance (like stability fees, collateral ratios) decided by **MKR token holders** via public governance votes.

---

### üîπ Why this matters
- Because contracts are public + immutable once deployed, users and searchers/liquidators can trust:
  - How collateralization is calculated.
  - How liquidations happen.
  - How governance parameters are applied.
- Protocol transparency = stronger trust, no hidden rules.

‚úÖ **In short:**  
Yes ‚Äî Aave and Maker publish their smart contracts openly, and loan governance (risk params, fees, collateral) is enforced by **on-chain code** plus token-holder governance.  

### üîπ Ethereum (L1)
- Base blockchain network.
- Provides security, consensus, and settlement.
- Hosts smart contracts for apps like Aave, Maker, Uniswap, etc.

---

### üîπ Aave
- A **lending protocol** deployed as smart contracts on Ethereum (and also on some L2s like Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism).
- Not its own chain ‚Äî it lives *on Ethereum or L2s*.

---

### üîπ MakerDAO
- Protocol behind the **DAI stablecoin**.
- Runs entirely on Ethereum smart contracts.
- Uses governance via MKR token to set parameters.
- Also **not its own chain**.

---

‚úÖ **In short:**
- **Ethereum = L1 blockchain.**
- **Aave & MakerDAO = applications/protocols built on Ethereum L1 (and some L2s).**
- They depend on Ethereum‚Äôs security, not their own consensus.  

### üîπ What is Base?
- A **Layer 2 blockchain** built by Coinbase.
- Uses the **OP Stack** (same tech as Optimism).
- Secures itself by posting data/transactions back to Ethereum (L1).

---

### üîπ Why it exists
- Cheaper & faster transactions than Ethereum mainnet.
- Fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
- Tightly integrated with Coinbase products ‚Üí easy on/off ramps.

---

### üîπ Key traits
- **Not an L1** ‚Üí it inherits security from Ethereum.
- **Rollup**: executes transactions off-chain, then batches them to Ethereum.
- **Ecosystem**: DeFi, NFTs, on-chain apps ‚Äî same as Ethereum, but lower gas.

---

‚úÖ **In short:**  
**Base = Coinbase‚Äôs Ethereum Layer 2 (built with Optimism tech).**  
It‚Äôs not its own L1 like Ethereum or Solana ‚Äî it‚Äôs an L2 rollup that depends on Ethereum for final security.  

### üîπ Sequencers (in L2s like Base, Arbitrum, Optimism)
- Role: order transactions and create L2 blocks.
- They **do not** run MEV auctions like Ethereum validators.
- They send compressed transaction data back to Ethereum (L1) for finality.
- Today: centralized (often a single sequencer per rollup, run by the project team).
- Future: roadmap to decentralize sequencing and enable shared MEV auctions.

---

### üîπ MEV Relays / Validators (Ethereum L1)
- **Validators**: chosen by Ethereum PoS to propose blocks.
- **MEV relays**: deliver block bundles (via MEV-Boost) to validators.
- This happens only on Ethereum L1, not inside Base/Arbitrum/Optimism (yet).

---

### üîπ Key Difference
- **Sequencer** = transaction orderer in an L2.
- **Validator/Relay** = transaction/bundle orderer in Ethereum L1 MEV auctions.
- Base‚Äôs sequencer (run by Coinbase) decides tx order **within Base**, but Base still posts the results to Ethereum, where L1 validators enforce finality.

---

‚úÖ **In short:**  
Coinbase‚Äôs Base sequencers are **not MEV relays or validators**. They are L2 ordering nodes. Ethereum L1 validators (with MEV relays) still decide the *final ordering at the base layer*.  

## üîπ L2 Landscape (Explanation)

- **Polygon**
  - PoS sidechain (separate validators), now expanding with zkEVM.
  - ‚úÖ Strength: broad ecosystem, enterprise adoption.
  - ‚ùå Weakness: PoS chain ‚â† Ethereum-level security.

- **Arbitrum**
  - Largest Optimistic Rollup by adoption.
  - ‚úÖ Strength: deep DeFi liquidity (GMX, Radiant, etc.).
  - ‚ùå Weakness: centralized sequencer, fraud proofs not yet fully live.

- **Optimism**
  - Pioneer Optimistic Rollup, builder of the OP Stack.
  - ‚úÖ Strength: ‚ÄúSuperchain‚Äù ecosystem effect.
  - ‚ùå Weakness: still centralized sequencing.

- **Base (Coinbase L2)**
  - Built with OP Stack, retail-friendly, Coinbase integrated.
  - ‚úÖ Strength: rapid adoption via Coinbase funnel.
  - ‚ùå Weakness: limited decentralization, sequencer run by Coinbase.

## üîπ TVL Ranking (Sept 2025, DeFiLlama)

| Rank | Network    | TVL (approx) |
|------|------------|--------------|
| 1    | **Arbitrum** | ~$14.2B |
| 2    | **Base**     | ~$9.1B |
| 3    | **Optimism** | ~$7.8B |
| 4    | **Polygon**  | ~$5.3B |

---

‚úÖ **In short:**
- **Arbitrum** leads in liquidity.
- **Base** has surged thanks to Coinbase funnel.
- **Optimism** strong due to OP Stack adoption.
- **Polygon** relevant, but trails Ethereum-native L2s in TVL.  

### üîπ Why integrate with L2s?

1. **Lower Transaction Costs**
  - L1 gas fees can spike to $20‚Äì$100+ per tx.
  - On L2s, fees are typically a few cents ‚Üí better UX for users.

2. **Higher Throughput**
  - L1 can handle ~15‚Äì20 TPS.
  - L2s batch txs ‚Üí effective throughput is much higher.
  - Suitable for gaming, micro-payments, NFT minting, etc.

3. **User Growth**
  - Many retail users (especially from Coinbase via **Base**) onboard directly to L2s.
  - Being on L2s = access to this user base.

4. **Liquidity & Ecosystem**
  - Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Polygon have billions in TVL and active DeFi/NFT communities.
  - Integrating gives exposure to existing liquidity pools and partnerships.

5. **Still Secured by Ethereum**
  - Unlike deploying on a non-Ethereum chain (e.g., Solana), L2s inherit Ethereum‚Äôs security.
  - Lower risk for your users‚Äô funds.

6. **Future-Proofing**
  - Ethereum‚Äôs roadmap (Danksharding, EIP-4844) is designed around L2s.
  - Deploying on L2s now = aligning with where the ecosystem is heading.

---

‚úÖ **In short:**  
You‚Äôd integrate with L2s for **cheaper fees, faster transactions, more users, and access to growing ecosystems**, all while keeping Ethereum-level security.  

## üîπ Ethereum‚Äôs Roadmap Impact on L2s

### **EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding, live in 2024)**
- Introduces **‚Äúblobs‚Äù** ‚Üí cheap data space in Ethereum blocks.
- L2s currently post calldata to Ethereum (expensive).
- With blobs ‚Üí data posting costs drop **10‚Äì100x**.
- Tx fees on L2s become **a few cents or less** ‚Üí micropayments, mass adoption practical.

### **Danksharding (future, full version)**
- Scales blobs massively (more data per block).
- Supports **hundreds of L2s** running cheaply in parallel.
- Ethereum L1 = data availability layer, all L2s inherit security.

‚úÖ **Impact:**
- Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Polygon zkEVM ‚Üí all get **cheaper fees + scalability**.
- Competition moves from *fees* ‚Üí to *ecosystem, liquidity, and user funnels*.

---

## üîπ Can you deploy Solidity contracts directly on L2?

**Yes.**
- L2s (Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Polygon zkEVM) are **EVM-compatible**.
- Write Solidity the same as on L1.
- Deploy via the L2 RPC endpoint.

### Example (ethers.js)
```js
const { ethers } = require("ethers");

// Connect to Base (L2) instead of Ethereum L1
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider("https://mainnet.base.org");
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(PRIVATE_KEY, provider);

// Standard Solidity contract deploy
const factory = new ethers.ContractFactory(abi, bytecode, wallet);
const contract = await factory.deploy();
console.log("Deployed to:", contract.target);
```
## üîπ Current Trends in Ethereum (2025)

### EIPs / Mainnet Upgrades
- **Pectra upgrade (May 2025)**: ~11 EIPs, including:
  - Smart EOAs (EIP-7702)
  - Optimized validator signature schemes
  - Blob parameterization (scaling data availability)
  - Historical block hash access
- Continued roll-out of **EIP-4844 (blobs)** ‚Üí cheaper L2 data posting.
- More efficient cryptography (BLS precompiles, lighter sigs).
- Growing focus on **account abstraction** for better wallet UX.

---

### L2 / Scaling Trends
- L2s (Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon zkEVM) taking a bigger share of tx volume.
- Post-Dencun/Pectra upgrades ‚Üí **L2 fees down 90‚Äì98%**.
- Experiments with **gasless L2s** and subsidized fee models.
- Rising TVL and app ecosystems moving toward L2-first deployment.

---
### üîπ ETH on L1 vs L2
- **ETH on L1 (mainnet):** Native ETH, universally recognized.
- **ETH on L2 (Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Polygon zkEVM):**
  - Technically an **IOU / representation of ETH** bridged from L1.
  - It exists in the L2‚Äôs state, not automatically on L1.

---

### üîπ Receiving ETH on an L2 wallet
- If someone sends you 1 ETH **on Base**, it lives in the Base network‚Äôs state.
- Your wallet address is the same, but balances are tracked separately by each chain.
- It will **not automatically appear on mainnet** ‚Äî only on Base.

---

### üîπ Moving ETH between L1 and L2
- To reflect ETH on both sides, you must use a **bridge**:
  - Deposit: lock ETH on Ethereum ‚Üí mint ETH on L2.
  - Withdraw: burn/release ETH on L2 ‚Üí unlock ETH on Ethereum.
- Bridges are built into each rollup (Arbitrum bridge, Optimism gateway, Base bridge, etc.).

---

‚úÖ **In short:**  
ETH on an L2 wallet **does not show up on mainnet by default**.  
You need to bridge it back to L1 if you want mainnet ETH.  

# üîπ Why the trie keeps growing
- Every new account, contract, or storage variable adds entries to the **state trie**.
- Even if some contracts are inactive, their state often remains.
- Over time ‚Üí trie = bigger and more complex.

---

# üîπ Hardware impact on full nodes
1. **Disk (SSD)**
  - State and history are stored in LevelDB/RocksDB.
  - The larger the trie, the bigger the on-disk database.
  - Today: hundreds of GBs (state + history).
  - Archival nodes (with all historical states) = several **terabytes**.

2. **RAM**
  - Node must cache part of the trie for performance.
  - As trie size grows, more RAM helps with fast lookups.
  - Typical full node: 16‚Äì32 GB RAM recommended for healthy performance.

3. **CPU**
  - Needed for hashing (`keccak256`) and verifying blocks.
  - Bigger trie = more hashing and lookups per block.

---

# üîπ Mitigations
- **Pruning**: Removes old historical state, keeps only latest.
- **Snapshots**: Speeds up state access instead of walking the trie every time.
- **Stateless roadmap**: Ethereum research aims to reduce how much state each node must hold.
- **Verkle tries (future)**: More efficient successor to the Merkle Patricia Trie.

---

‚úÖ **In short:**  
Yes ‚Äî as the trie grows, **disk and RAM needs go up** for full nodes. That‚Äôs why Ethereum clients recommend SSDs and large memory. Future upgrades (Verkle tries, pruning, statelessness) aim to keep node requirements manageable.  


# üîπ Full Node vs Archival Node (Ethereum)

### Full Node
- **Stores:**
  - Current state (balances, storage, contract code).
  - Recent block history (usually a few thousand blocks).
- **Deletes/prunes:**
  - Old historical state (past account balances, storage snapshots).
- **Purpose:**
  - Can validate all new transactions and blocks.
  - Keeps network secure.
  - Enough for running wallets, dApps, validators, and explorers that only need *latest* state.
- **Storage size (2025):** ~500‚Äì800 GB on SSD.

---

### Archival Node
- **Stores:**
  - Everything a full node does **plus** all historical states (every balance, storage slot, and contract state at every block since genesis).
- **Never prunes:** keeps the entire chain history.
- **Purpose:**
  - For explorers (like Etherscan), analytics, research.
  - Useful if you want to query: ‚ÄúWhat was Alice‚Äôs balance at block 7,000,000?‚Äù
  - Not needed for normal use.
- **Storage size (2025):** 15‚Äì20+ TB (grows constantly).

---

### Key Difference
- **Full node:** Only latest state ‚Üí efficient, enough to participate in consensus.
- **Archival node:** All historical states ‚Üí massive storage, mainly for research/exploration.

---

‚úÖ **In short:**
- **Full node** = lean, validates current chain, recommended for most users/validators.
- **Archival node** = full history of everything, needed only for explorers, researchers, or analytics platforms.  


# üîπ Lite Nodes on L2s

### 1. Optimistic Rollups (Arbitrum, Optimism, Base)
- **Sequencer**: orders txs and posts compressed data (calldata/blobs) to Ethereum L1.
- **Lite node** on L2:
  - Doesn‚Äôt hold full state.
  - Verifies L2 block headers and proofs of data availability.
  - For deeper queries (balances, logs), it asks a full L2 node.
- Security: ultimately backed by **Ethereum full nodes**, since rollups post data to L1.

---

### 2. zk-Rollups (Polygon zkEVM, zkSync, StarkNet)
- Post **validity proofs** (zk-SNARKs) to L1.
- **Lite node** on L2:
  - Can cheaply verify proofs without replaying every transaction.
  - Requires very little storage or computation.
- This makes zk-rollups especially friendly for light clients.

---

### 3. Practical Reality (2025)
- Most users (e.g., MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet) **don‚Äôt run full or lite nodes**.
- They connect to RPC providers (Infura, Alchemy, QuickNode, etc.).
- Research and some projects are working on **trust-minimized light clients** for L2s, but adoption is still early.

---

‚úÖ **In short:**  
Yes ‚Äî L2s can have lite nodes:
- **Optimistic rollups** ‚Üí light clients that verify headers + fraud-proof system.
- **zk-rollups** ‚Üí even better, since validity proofs allow cheap verification.  
  But today, most apps just connect to RPC providers instead of running a lite node.  


# üîπ What are zk-Rollups?
- A **Layer 2 scaling solution** that batches many transactions off-chain and posts:
  1. **Compressed transaction data** ‚Üí to Ethereum L1 (for availability).
  2. A **validity proof** (zk-SNARK/STARK) ‚Üí to Ethereum L1 (for correctness).

- ‚Äúzk‚Äù = zero-knowledge ‚Üí proofs show a statement is true without revealing all details.

---

# üîπ How it works (step by step)
1. Users send transactions ‚Üí sequencer/rollup node collects them.
2. Rollup executes all txs off-chain.
3. Instead of sending every computation to L1, it generates a **cryptographic proof** that all txs were valid.
4. Proof + minimal data are submitted to Ethereum L1.
5. Ethereum full nodes verify the proof very efficiently (milliseconds), without re-running all txs.

---

# üîπ Why it‚Äôs powerful
- **Scalability:** Thousands of txs compressed into one proof ‚Üí huge throughput.
- **Cheap verification:** Ethereum only checks the proof, not every tx.
- **Fast finality:** Once proof is accepted on L1, txs are considered final.
- **Security:** Inherits Ethereum L1 security ‚Äî if the proof checks out, txs are valid.

---

# üîπ Examples
- **Polygon zkEVM** ‚Üí aims for full EVM compatibility using zk-proofs.
- **zkSync Era** ‚Üí zk-rollup with a focus on developer-friendly tooling.
- **StarkNet** ‚Üí zk-rollup using STARKs (different proof system, more scalable).

---

# üîπ Is it only an L2 feature?
- Mostly **yes today**: zk-rollups are used as Ethereum L2s.
- But the **concept is more general**:
  - L1 blockchains themselves could adopt zk-proofs internally (e.g., zk-powered consensus).
  - Some projects are exploring **zk-L1s** (chains that use zk-proofs as their native consensus).
  - Example: Mina Protocol markets itself as a ‚Äúzk-L1.‚Äù

---

‚úÖ **In short:**
- zk-Rollups = Ethereum L2 feature that scales by posting **validity proofs** to L1.
- Not limited to L2s ‚Üí zk-proofs can also be used at the L1 level, but Ethereum currently applies them in L2s.  

# üîπ Does Geth check zk-proofs in block payloads?
- **No.**
- Ethereum L1 (Geth, Nethermind, Besu, etc.) **does not natively handle zk-proofs** inside execution payloads.
- Ethereum still executes *its own transactions* normally (every tx is re-run by every full node).

---

# üîπ Where zk-proofs live
- zk-rollups (Polygon zkEVM, zkSync, StarkNet) are **smart contracts deployed on Ethereum L1**.
- These contracts:
  - Accept compressed rollup transaction data + zk-proof.
  - Verify the proof inside the contract (using precompiles for zk-SNARK/STARK verification).
  - Update the rollup‚Äôs state root if valid.

---

# üîπ What Geth actually does
- Geth just sees: ‚ÄúOh, here‚Äôs a transaction calling the rollup contract.‚Äù
- It runs the contract code like any other tx.
- The contract itself runs the zk-verification logic.
- Geth doesn‚Äôt need to ‚Äúknow about zk-rollups‚Äù ‚Äî it just executes EVM code.

---

# üîπ Why it‚Äôs not hardcoded
- Ethereum is general-purpose:
  - zk-rollups, optimistic rollups, DeFi apps, NFTs ‚Üí all are just **smart contracts**.
- The protocol doesn‚Äôt need special zk-logic at the client level.
- Instead, zk-rollups embed verification logic in their contracts.

---

‚úÖ **In short:**
- Geth is **not hardcoded** to check for zk-proofs in block payloads.
- zk-rollups are implemented as smart contracts on Ethereum.
- Geth just executes those contracts ‚Äî the zk-proof verification happens *inside the rollup contract*.  

# üîπ Gas Guzzlers (Top Contracts by Gas Consumption)

### 1. Tether: USDT Stablecoin
- **Fees last 3hrs:** ~$4,887 (1.08 ETH)
- **Fees last 24hrs:** ~$55,731 (12.30 ETH)
- **% of gas used:** ~6‚Äì7% of all Ethereum gas.
- Why? USDT is the most traded stablecoin, so transfers and approvals eat up lots of gas.

---

### 2. Uniswap V2: Router 2
- **Fees last 3hrs:** ~$1,153 (0.25 ETH)
- **Fees last 24hrs:** ~$15,133 (3.34 ETH)
- **% of gas used:** ~3.2%.
- Why? Users still swap tokens via older Uniswap V2 contracts. Each swap = multiple ERC20 transfers + liquidity pool logic.

---

### 3. Circle: USDC Token
- **Fees last 3hrs:** ~$2,303 (0.51 ETH)
- **Fees last 24hrs:** ~$28,244 (6.23 ETH)
- **% of gas used:** ~3.7%.
- Why? Like USDT, USDC is a top stablecoin. Heavy daily use for DeFi, trading, payments.

---

### 4. Uniswap V4: Universal Router
- **Fees last 3hrs:** ~$1,498 (0.33 ETH)
- **Fees last 24hrs:** ~$16,520 (3.65 ETH)
- **% of gas used:** ~2%.
- Why? The new Uniswap V4 router that aggregates liquidity across pools. Becoming more active as traders migrate.

---

# üîπ What this means
- Stablecoins (USDT, USDC) + DeFi protocols (Uniswap) **dominate Ethereum gas usage**.
- High gas usage = they are the most **actively used contracts**.
- When gas prices spike, it‚Äôs often due to heavy demand from swaps and stablecoin transfers.

‚úÖ **In short:**
- **USDT & USDC**: heavy gas from constant transfers.
- **Uniswap (V2 & V4)**: heavy gas from token swaps.
- Together, these account for **10%+ of Ethereum‚Äôs gas use daily**.  


| Rank | Contract / dApp              | What it is                                                                 |
|------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | **Tether: USDT Stablecoin**  | ERC-20 stablecoin pegged to USD. Most traded token, heavy gas from transfers. |
| 2    | **Uniswap V2: Router 2**     | Routing contract for swaps/liquidity in Uniswap V2. Still widely used.       |
| 3    | **Circle: USDC Token**       | ERC-20 stablecoin from Circle, pegged to USD. Heavy daily transfers.        |
| 4    | **Uniswap V4: Universal Router** | Latest Uniswap router, aggregates liquidity across pools. Growing adoption. |
| 5    | **OKX: DEX Router**          | Router for OKX‚Äôs on-chain swap/DEX service.                                 |
| 6    | **MetaMask: Swap Router**    | Contract used by MetaMask‚Äôs built-in swap feature.                          |
| 7    | **0x: Allowance Holder**     | Utility contract in 0x protocol, manages token approvals/allowances.        |
| 8    | **Pendle: RouterV4**         | Router for Pendle Finance (yield trading protocol).                         |
| 9    | **Banana Gun: Router 2**     | Bot-driven trading app/router for sniping tokens quickly.                   |
| 10   | **Fake_Phishing1341503**     | Flagged phishing contract ‚Äî not a real dApp, marked by Etherscan as scam.   |
|      |                              |                                                                            |
|      |                              |                                                                            |# üîπ 0x: Allowance Holder

### What it is
- Part of the **0x Protocol**, a popular decentralized exchange (DEX) infrastructure.
- It‚Äôs a **smart contract that manages token allowances** for traders using 0x.

---

### Why it exists
- In Ethereum, before a smart contract can move your ERC-20 tokens, you must call `approve(spender, amount)`.
- For DEX aggregators (like 0x), users would otherwise have to approve **each swap separately**.
- The **Allowance Holder** solves this by:
  - Letting you grant 0x a token allowance once.
  - Reusing that approval across many trades.

---

### How it works (step by step)
1. User approves `0x Allowance Holder` contract to spend, e.g., 1000 USDC.
2. When trading, the 0x exchange contract calls the Allowance Holder to move tokens on behalf of the user.
3. The Allowance Holder transfers tokens into the DEX pool or to another trader.

---

### Benefits
- **Gas efficiency**: fewer repeated approvals.
- **User convenience**: one approval unlocks many trades.
- **Security**: tokens only move within the 0x system; revoking approval stops it.

---

### Risks
- Like any approval system, if the Allowance Holder contract (or 0x protocol) were exploited, approved tokens could be at risk.
- Best practice: **approve only what you need** or revoke allowances later.

---

‚úÖ **In short:**  
The **0x Allowance Holder** is a helper contract that manages ERC-20 token approvals so users don‚Äôt have to constantly re-approve tokens for every 0x trade. It‚Äôs about efficiency + UX.  

# üîπ Does Etherscan need a Full Node or an Archival Node?

### Full Node
- Stores: **latest state** + recent blocks.
- Can tell you:
  - Current balances, token transfers, contract calls.
  - Gas used in the latest txs/blocks.
- Cannot tell you:
  - **Historical state at an arbitrary old block** (e.g., Alice‚Äôs balance at block 7,000,000).

### Archival Node
- Stores: **every historical state** since genesis.
- Can answer **deep history queries** like:
  - "What was Uniswap Router gas usage in 2021?"
  - "What was balance/allowance of this address 2 years ago?"

---

### What "Top 50 Gas Guzzlers" needs
- The dashboard shows **gas usage for the last 3 hours / 24 hours**.
- That only requires **a full node**, since it just tracks recent transactions.
- Etherscan *does* run **archival nodes** too, but mostly for things like:
  - Historical charts going back years.
  - Showing balances at any past block.
  - Time-travel debugging.

---

‚úÖ **Answer:**  
For **Top Gas Guzzlers (last 3h / 24h)** ‚Üí **full node is enough**.  
For **historical gas analytics (weeks, months, years)** ‚Üí they rely on **archival nodes**.  

# üîπ Gas Spenders (Top 50 EOAs Paying Gas)

### 1. Fake_Phishing1338353
- Spent ~$5,216 in last 24h (1.10 ETH).
- Likely flagged as a malicious / scam account by Etherscan.
- Shows scammers/phishers still pay significant gas to operate bots/contracts.

### 2. Coinbase: Deposit
- Spent ~$10,393 in last 24h (2.20 ETH).
- This is Coinbase‚Äôs deposit account ‚Üí processes thousands of user transfers daily, hence high gas.

### 3. Fake_Phishing1259784
- Another phishing account flagged by Etherscan.
- $3,241 (0.69 ETH) in gas last 24h.

### 4. jaredfromsubway
- Famous MEV bot operator.
- $64,244 (13.60 ETH) spent in last 24h.
- Runs sandwich attacks / arbitrage strategies, which burn huge gas but earn higher profits.

### 5‚Äì7. More Fake_Phishing accounts
- Each flagged phishing wallet, still actively sending txs.
- Spent $2,600‚Äì$3,300 in gas fees over 24h.

---

# üîπ Key Insights
- **Exchanges (like Coinbase)** spend gas to process massive user inflows/outflows.
- **MEV bots (e.g. jaredfromsubway)** spend large gas amounts to front-run and capture profit.
- **Phishing / scam accounts** spend gas too ‚Äî proof that even malicious activity pays Ethereum network fees.

‚úÖ **In short:**  
This dashboard highlights *which EOAs* (not contracts) are paying the most gas fees. It‚Äôs dominated by:
- Legit services (Coinbase),
- MEV bot operators,
- and flagged malicious actors (phishing wallets).  
# üîπ Gas Guzzlers vs Gas Spenders

| Category       | What it means | Who appears here | Example from screenshots |
|----------------|--------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| **Gas Guzzlers** | Smart contracts / accounts that **consume** the most gas when executed. | Contracts like stablecoins, DEX routers, DeFi protocols. | Tether (USDT), Uniswap Router, Circle (USDC). |
| **Gas Spenders** | Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) that **pay** the most ETH in gas fees. | Users, exchanges, bots, or attackers sending many transactions. | Coinbase Deposit account, MEV bot `jaredfromsubway`, phishing wallets. |

---

### ‚úÖ In short:
- **Guzzlers** = which *contracts* are heavy on gas usage.
- **Spenders** = which *EOAs* are footing the bill for gas.

### ‚öô Key EIPs in Pectra & Their Effects

| EIP | What It Does | Practical Impact |
|-----|---------------|-------------------|
| **EIP-7702 (Smart EOAs / Account Abstraction for EOAs)** | Lets regular user wallets (EOAs) temporarily attach code and behave like a smart contract for a transaction.  [oai_citation:3‚Ä°Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/blog/ethereum-pectra-upgrade-dev-guide-to-11-eips?utm_source=chatgpt.com) | Enables batching, gas-sponsorship, more flexible UX without needing a full smart wallet setup. Some contract checks (like `EXTCODESIZE == 0`) might need adjusting.  [oai_citation:4‚Ä°Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/blog/ethereum-pectra-upgrade-dev-guide-to-11-eips?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| **EIP-7251 (Max Effective Balance Increase)** | Increases the maximum stake a validator can earn rewards on from 32 ETH up to **2,048 ETH**.  [oai_citation:5‚Ä°Datawallet](https://www.datawallet.com/crypto/ethereum-pectra-upgrade-explained?utm_source=chatgpt.com) | Large validators or staking services can consolidate/trust fewer validators, reduce overhead.  [oai_citation:6‚Ä°Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/learn/ethereum-pectra-upgrade?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| **EIP-7002** | Allows execution layer triggered withdrawals (validators can initiate exits directly)  [oai_citation:7‚Ä°Datawallet](https://www.datawallet.com/crypto/ethereum-pectra-upgrade-explained?utm_source=chatgpt.com) | More control/flexibility for validators and staking services.  [oai_citation:8‚Ä°Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/learn/ethereum-pectra-upgrade?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| **EIP-6110** | Validator deposit supply / onboarding modifications (making validator activation smoother)  [oai_citation:9‚Ä°Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/learn/ethereum-pectra-upgrade?utm_source=chatgpt.com) | Reduces delays for validators; makes staking more efficient.  [oai_citation:10‚Ä°Crypto APIs](https://cryptoapis.io/blog/302-ethereum-pectra-mainnet-launch-on-may-7-2025-timeline-key-changes-and-preparation?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| **EIP-7691 & related rollup/data availability EIPs** | Increases ‚Äúblob‚Äù capacity per block; adjusts ‚Äúblob vs calldata‚Äù cost dynamics; optimizations for data posting.  [oai_citation:11‚Ä°Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/blog/ethereum-pectra-upgrade-dev-guide-to-11-eips?utm_source=chatgpt.com) | Lower costs for Layer-2 rollups, better network scalability, more predictable fee behavior.  [oai_citation:12‚Ä°Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/blog/ethereum-pectra-upgrade-dev-guide-to-11-eips?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| **EIP-2537** | BLS12-381 curve precompile support (faster signature ops)  [oai_citation:13‚Ä°Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/learn/ethereum-pectra-upgrade?utm_source=chatgpt.com) | Helps proofs, zk-systems, validators, consensus-relevant cryptography to be more efficient.  [oai_citation:14‚Ä°Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/learn/ethereum-pectra-upgrade?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| **EIP-2935** | Store historical block hashes in state so contracts/light clients can access past hash values more easily.  [oai_citation:15‚Ä°Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/learn/ethereum-pectra-upgrade?utm_source=chatgpt.com) | Improves light client design, randomness, contract logic that needs past block hashes.  [oai_citation:16‚Ä°Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/learn/ethereum-pectra-upgrade?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |

### üîç Impacts & Considerations

- **For developers / dApps:**
  - Contract logic relying on assumptions about EOAs vs contract accounts may break (because EOAs can have ‚Äúcode‚Äù under certain conditions under EIP-7702).  [oai_citation:17‚Ä°Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/blog/ethereum-pectra-upgrade-dev-guide-to-11-eips?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
  - Gas-cost profiles may shift (especially around calldata vs blob usage). Optimizing for blobs becomes more important.

- **For users / wallets:**
  - More UX improvements: batch transactions, sponsored gas, etc.  [oai_citation:18‚Ä°Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/blog/ethereum-pectra-upgrade-dev-guide-to-11-eips?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
  - You might see new transaction types in wallets.

- **For validators / staking infrastructure:**
  - Can stake more per validator (MaxEB).
  - More efficient onboarding / exit.
  - Possibly fewer nodes needed if large operators leverage higher stake.

- **Network scaling:**
  - Blobs capacity increase helps Layer-2 solutions.
  - Historical data access helps light clients / certain contracts.
