## Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) Summary

### What is ZKP?
A cryptographic method where a prover convinces a verifier that a statement is true without revealing the underlying information.
- **Prover:** Has the knowledge/evidence.
- **Verifier:** Confirms validity without learning the details.

---

### Types of ZKPs
- **Interactive:** Back-and-forth communication, more secure but slower.
- **Non-interactive (zk-SNARKs):** Single proof with verification key, faster and scalable (common in blockchains).

---

### Applications in Blockchain
- **Authentication:** Prove access rights without revealing keys.
- **Transactions:** Private transfers without exposing sender, receiver, or amount.
- **Identity Verification:** Confirm identity without disclosing personal data.
- **Supply Chain:** Verify authenticity of goods without revealing manufacturing details.

---

### Key Properties
- **Completeness:** Honest prover convinces honest verifier.
- **Soundness:** Dishonest prover can’t fool the verifier.
- **Zero-knowledge:** No extra info leaked beyond truth of statement.

---

### Protocol Variants
- **zk-SNARKs:** Widely used, efficient.
- **zk-STARKs:** Scalable, transparent.
- **Bulletproofs:** Efficient range proofs.
- **SONIC:** Non-interactive, scalable.
- **PLONK:** Efficient, flexible for blockchain.

---

### Advantages
- Strong privacy.
- Higher security without intermediaries.
- Scalable and flexible for many use cases.

### Disadvantages
- Complex to implement.
- Performance overhead.
- Relies on cryptographic trust assumptions.
- Still early-stage, limited adoption.

---

### Developer Implementation (High-level Steps)
1. Choose a protocol (e.g., zk-SNARK, zk-STARK).
2. Design the proof system.
3. Implement proof generation algorithm.
4. Implement proof verification algorithm.
5. Integrate into the DApp workflow.

---

**Bottom line:**  
ZKPs enable secure, private verification without revealing sensitive data, making them essential for privacy-preserving blockchain applications.

## Realistic zk-SNARK Workflow with ZoKrates
### Step 1: Write ZoKrates Program
Define a circuit: prove knowledge of x such that x * x = y.
x: Private input (secret).
y: Public input.
Proof shows prover knows some x without revealing it.
```zokrates
// square.zok
def main(private field x, field y) -> bool:
return x * x == y
```

### Step 2: Compile and Generate Proof
Commands to run with ZoKrates CLI:

```bash
# Compile ZoKrates program
zokrates compile -i square.zok

# Setup trusted setup
zokrates setup

# Export Solidity verifier
zokrates export-verifier

# Compute witness for x=3, y=9
zokrates compute-witness -a 3 9

# Generate proof
zokrates generate-proof
```

### Step 3: Solidity Verifier (Auto-Generated)
ZoKrates outputs a verifier contract. Simplified form:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

library Pairing {
// Elliptic curve operations...
}

contract Verifier {
using Pairing for *;

    struct VerifyingKey {
        // zk-SNARK verifying key params
    }

    struct Proof {
        // zk-SNARK proof params
    }

    function verifyProof(
        Proof memory proof,
        uint256[1] memory input
    ) public view returns (bool) {
        // Cryptographic checks (pairings)
        return true; // true if proof is valid
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Integrating Verifier into a DApp
Use the verifier inside another contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SquareProofApp {
Verifier public verifier;

    constructor(address _verifier) {
        verifier = Verifier(_verifier);
    }

    function checkSquare(
        Verifier.Proof memory proof,
        uint256[1] memory input
    ) public view returns (bool) {
        return verifier.verifyProof(proof, input);
    }
}
```

## 3. Conceptual Diagram
```lua
Prover (knows x) ----> [Proof] ----> Verifier (knows y)
|                                       |
|-- secret x never revealed ------------|
```
- Prover: Generates proof off-chain with ZoKrates.
- Verifier: Runs verifyProof on-chain with public input y.
- Result: Proof accepted if condition (x² = y) holds.

✅ Summary

Toy demo: Hash check simulates ZK idea in Solidity.

Real zk-SNARK workflow:

Write ZoKrates circuit.

Compile, setup, generate proofs off-chain.

Deploy verifier contract on-chain.

Verify proofs cheaply and securely.

This enables a Prover to prove knowledge of a secret without ever revealing the secret itself.
