## `ERC20FlashMint` (OpenZeppelin Contracts v5.x)

### What it is
- An extension for ERC‑20 tokens providing **flash loan** capability via temporary minting and burning.  [oai_citation:0‡OpenZeppelin Docs](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/token/ERC20?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- Implements the ERC‑3156 flash loan standard.  [oai_citation:1‡OpenZeppelin Docs](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/token/ERC20?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

### Key Functions

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `maxFlashLoan(token)` | Returns the maximum amount of `token` that can be flash‑loaned.  [oai_citation:2‡OpenZeppelin Docs](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/token/ERC20?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| `flashFee(token, value)` | Computes the fee to borrow `value` tokens (can be zero if not overridden).  [oai_citation:3‡OpenZeppelin Docs](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/token/ERC20?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| `flashLoan(receiver, token, value, data)` | Performs the flash loan: mints `value` tokens to `receiver`, calls the receiver’s callback, then ensures return of `value + fee` inside the same transaction. Reverts otherwise.  [oai_citation:4‡OpenZeppelin Docs](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/token/ERC20?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |

---

### How It Works (Flow)

1. Caller requests a flash loan via `flashLoan(...)`.
2. Contract mints the requested amount to the `receiver`.
3. Receiver executes its flash‑loan callback (implements `IERC3156FlashBorrower`) using the tokens.
4. End of transaction: Receiver must return `value + fee`. If not, transaction reverts.
5. Token contract burns the borrowed amount (net supply unchanged, aside from fees paid).

---

### Use Cases

- Arbitrage, trade opportunities within a single transaction.
- Temporary liquidity needs (bridging, rebalancing).
- DeFi primitives needing short‑term token borrow without long‑term collateral.

---

### Risks & Caveats

- All actions must happen in one transaction → risk of running out of gas.
- Receiver contract must correctly implement required interface/callback.
- Potential for abuse / unexpected state changes via callbacks.
- If token has supply caps or other constraints, `maxFlashLoan` must consider them if overridden.

---

### Example Snippet

```solidity
interface IERC3156FlashBorrower {
    function onFlashLoan(
        address initiator,
        address token,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 fee,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external returns (bytes32);
}

contract MyFlashUser is IERC3156FlashBorrower {
    function doStuffWithFlashLoan(address flashToken, uint256 amount) external {
        ERC20FlashMint(flashToken).flashLoan(
            address(this),
            flashToken,
            amount,
            ""
        );
        // in onFlashLoan: use the tokens, then return amount + fee
    }

    function onFlashLoan(
        address initiator,
        address token,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 fee,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external returns (bytes32) {
        // business logic using `amount`
        // then approve and return tokens + fee
        IERC20(token).approve(address(this), amount + fee);
        return keccak256("ERC3156FlashBorrower.onFlashLoan");
    }
}
```


## Flash Loans & Gas Risks: Why Running Out of Gas Can Happen

When you use flash loans, all logic (borrowing, doing something with the borrowed funds, paying back + fees) must happen in **one transaction**. That means there’s a risk that you run out of gas. Here’s how, and how to mitigate.

---

### Why Gas Issues Occur with Flash Loans

- Flash loan logic often includes many on‑chain operations: swaps, price oracle queries, multiple external calls. All cost gas.
- Transaction may hit block gas limit or the gas you set for it. If logic is too heavy, gas runs out → whole transaction reverts.
- If business logic / callback is complex or calls into many contracts or loops over large data, gas cost balloons.
- Estimating gas poorly: transaction might be underfunded. Also external calls inside callback may require more gas than expected.

---

### Example Scenarios

1. **Arbitrage Strategy**: Borrow tokens, swap on DEX A, swap on DEX B, check price oracles, repay + fee. Multiple steps + cross‑contract calls.

2. **Batch Operations / Loops**: Flash callback loops over many items (e.g. many token pairs or many user addresses). If list is large, loop costs too much → out of gas.

3. **External Contract Calls**: Logic calls external contracts (could be slow or high‑gas), or uses delegatecalls etc. If those external contracts also have complex logic, gas cost escalates.

---

### Mitigations & Best Practices

- Keep callback / business logic lightweight. Minimize external calls, avoid large loops.
- Use gas‑efficient patterns: e.g. fixed size loops, caching, less storage writes.
- Estimate gas generously; include margin for unexpected external costs.
- Possibly break up logic: some parts off‑chain or in separate transactions (if they don’t need to be inside the flash loan).
- Use tools / static analysis to estimate worst‑case gas cost.

## How to Estimate Gas Limit in an Enterprise App

Here are full best practices & methods to reliably estimate gas limits in production‑grade smart contracts or enterprise apps, drawing on community resources.

---

### Best Practices & Methods

| Step | What to Do |
|---|-------------|
| **1. Use RPC / Node Simulation** | Use `eth_estimateGas` (via Ethers.js / Web3 / your node) to simulate the transaction. |
| **2. Add Safety Buffer** | After getting the estimate, multiply by a margin (e.g. 10‑30%) to account for state changes, external calls, or unpredictable behavior. |
| **3. Use Historical Gas Usage** | Track past transactions (for the same functions with similar inputs) to see what gas was actually used. Use that data to inform future estimates. |
| **4. Stress‑Test / Simulate Edge Cases** | Use testnets or local mainnet forks. Try heavy input sizes, loops, external contract calls to see worst‑cases. |
| **5. Monitor & Adjust** | In production, measure gas usage; if many transactions fail due to insufficient gas, increase buffers. If always overestimated by a lot, you can reduce buffer to save cost. |
| **6. Fail Gracefully in UI** | If estimate fails (e.g. simulation reverts), show user error or disable action rather than letting transaction fail unexpectedly. Also provide fallback upper bound if needed. |

---

### Tools & Techniques

- **Hardhat / Foundry / Truffle gas reporters** to profile functions.  [oai_citation:0‡Medium](https://medium.com/%40abhijeet.sinha383/how-to-calculate-gas-and-costs-while-deploying-solidity-contracts-and-functions-54007d321626?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Bytecode analysis + `estimateGas` on deployment** to approximate deployment cost.  [oai_citation:1‡JamesBachini.com](https://jamesbachini.com/how-to-calculate-gas-costs-for-solidity-contracts/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- Use of test scripts / mocks / benchmarking to measure gas of external calls, loops, storage writes.  [oai_citation:2‡Metaschool](https://metaschool.so/articles/gas-optimization-techniques-in-solidity/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

### Things to Watch Out

- **State changes**: contract state may be different between simulation and real transaction → gas usage might differ.
- **Looping / dynamic data structures**: looping over large arrays or unbounded input sizes can blow up gas.  [oai_citation:3‡Ethereum Stack Exchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/154377/optimizing-gas-costs-in-solidity-smart-contracts-best-practices?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **External calls / fallback / delegatecalls**: calling into other contracts adds unpredictability.
- **Storage writes are expensive**: writes cost much more than reads; minimizing them matters.  [oai_citation:4‡Metaschool](https://metaschool.so/articles/gas-optimization-techniques-in-solidity/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Compiler settings**: optimizer on/off, number of runs, layout changes can influence gas consumption.  [oai_citation:5‡Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/solidity-gas-optimization?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Block gas limit & network fluctuations**: there’s a maximum gas per block; congestion or node behavior may change costs.
- **Gas price vs Gas limit**: estimation is about limit (units of gas), but users also care about price (gwei). Both matter for UX.

## What is `calldata`

- `calldata` is a **data location** in Solidity for parameters of external function calls.  [oai_citation:0‡Ethereum Stack Exchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/74442/when-should-i-use-calldata-and-when-should-i-use-memory?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- It is **read‑only** — you cannot modify data in `calldata`.  [oai_citation:1‡Ethereum Stack Exchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/74442/when-should-i-use-calldata-and-when-should-i-use-memory?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- It is **non‑persistent / ephemeral** — only exists for the duration of the external call, then discarded.  [oai_citation:2‡Ethereum Stack Exchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/74442/when-should-i-use-calldata-and-when-should-i-use-memory?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

## How it differs from `memory` & `storage`

| Feature           | `calldata`                                         | `memory`                                          | `storage`                                      |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Modifiable?       | No                                                 | Yes                                               | Yes                                            |
| Persistence       | No (temporary, during call)                       | No (during call/function execution)              | Yes (writes stay on blockchain state)         |
| Use case          | External function params, large read‑only data     | Temporary data inside functions, mutable data    | State variables, long‑term contract data      |
| Gas cost          | Cheaper than copying to memory for external args   | More expensive when copying or when many ops     | Most expensive, especially for writes          |

---

## Typical Use Cases & Advantages

- Use `calldata` when you need to read from arguments passed to external/public functions but don't need to modify them.  [oai_citation:3‡Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/what-is-the-difference-between-memory-and-calldata-in-solidity?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- Especially useful for dynamic types (`arrays`, `bytes`, `structs`) as input for external calls — avoids copying into memory, saves gas.  [oai_citation:4‡DEV Community](https://dev.to/turboza/solidity-external-vs-public-memory-vs-calldata-vs-storage-33bg?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- When implementing “view” or “pure” logic that doesn't change state and only inspects input parameters.

---

## Example

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Example {
    // `numbers` is read only because it's `calldata`
    function sum(uint256[] calldata numbers) external pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 total = 0;
        for (uint i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
            total += numbers[i];
        }
        return total;
    }
}
```

## Function State Mutability in Solidity

In Solidity, functions can be annotated with *mutability modifiers* which tell the compiler / EVM how the function uses or changes state. Below are the main modifiers and what they mean.

---

| Modifier | What It Means | What It Can / Can’t Do | When to Use |
|---|------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|
| `pure` | **Most restrictive**. Can’t read _from_ state variables or write to state. Only depends on its inputs and local computations.  [oai_citation:0‡docs.soliditylang.org](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com) | ✅ Can compute based on arguments / local vars <br> ❌ Cannot read state vars <br> ❌ Cannot write state <br> ❌ Cannot access `msg`, `block` (with some exceptions), cannot call non‑pure functions | Use for helper / utility functions (math, formatting, etc.) that are deterministic and don’t depend on contract data. |
| `view` | Can **read** state, but cannot modify it. | ✅ Can read state variables, return state, etc. <br> ❌ Cannot write set state vars, emit events, or modify storage. <br> ❌ Cannot call non‑view / non‑pure functions that modify state.  [oai_citation:1‡docs.soliditylang.org](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com) | Use for getters, status checks, or logic that inspects contract state but doesn’t change it. |
| no modifier (default) | Function can read and write state. It can modify storage, emit events, call other functions, etc. | ✅ Full capability <br> ❌ Costs gas when called (since it changes state or at least might) <br> ❌ Cannot receive Ether unless `payable` is enabled if Ether is being sent. | Use when you want to change contract state, e.g. token transfers, updating data, etc. |
| `payable` | Allows the function to receive Ether. Without this, functions reject incoming Ether. | ✅ Can accept Ether via `msg.value` <br> ✅ Can modify state <br> Can combine with other modifiers (e.g. `public payable`) <br> ❌ If not `payable`, Ether sent to that function fails.  [oai_citation:2‡Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/solidity-functions?utm_source=chatgpt.com) | Use when you expect the function to receive Ether, e.g. deposits, payments. |

---

## Additional Notes

- Functions marked `view` & `pure` still cost gas when they are called **within** a transaction (from non‑view / non‑pure functions), because reading state and executing code consumes gas. Calling them **externally** (off‑chain) is “free” (no transaction gas cost).  [oai_citation:3‡CoinsBench](https://coinsbench.com/understanding-view-and-pure-functions-in-solidity-cd8a84074b20?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- The compiler may warn you if you could use `pure` or `view` but haven’t specified them (helps with gas optimization & code clarity).  [oai_citation:4‡Medium](https://medium.com/coinmonks/function-state-mutability-in-solidity-acb850eedccc?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- Some global variables/functions are considered state‑reading: accessing `block.timestamp`, `msg.sender`, `address(this).balance`, or even reading `msg.data` may prevent a function from being `pure`.  [oai_citation:5‡docs.soliditylang.org](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

## Examples

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Examples {
    uint256 public x;

    // 1. pure: only uses inputs, nothing else
    function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) public pure returns (uint256) {
        return a + b;
    }

    // 2. view: reads state, but doesn't change it
    function getXPlus(uint256 a) public view returns (uint256) {
        return x + a;
    }

    // 3. default (non‑view, non‑pure): reads & writes
    function setX(uint256 newX) public {
        x = newX;
    }

    // 4. payable: can receive Ether when called
    function deposit() public payable {
        // track deposit or use msg.value
    }
}
```

## Different Data Locations / States in a Solidity Contract

Solidity uses different places to store data, each with its own properties. These matter for gas costs, mutability, persistence, etc.

---

| Location | What it is | What you can/can’t do | When to use |
|---|------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|
| **storage** | Persistent state on the blockchain. State variables (declared at contract level) live here.  [oai_citation:0‡Medium](https://medium.com/coinmonks/solidity-storage-vs-memory-vs-calldata-8c7e8c38bce?utm_source=chatgpt.com) | ✅ Can read & write <br> ✅ Value persists across transactions <br> ✅ Expensive gas cost especially for writes <br> ❌ Not destroyed after function ends <br> ❌ Modifying is costly | Use for data you want to keep forever: balances, ownership, settings, etc. |
| **memory** | Function‑scope temporary storage. Non‑persistent; data lives while function executes.  [oai_citation:1‡Jennifer Bland](https://www.jenniferbland.com/storage-vs-memory-vs-calldata-understanding-data-locations-in-solidity/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) | ✅ Mutable inside the function <br> ✅ You can read/write freely within function <br> ❌ Doesn’t persist after execution ends <br> ❌ More gas than calldata for copying when large data structures involved | Use for temporary variables, local computations, arrays/structs you construct internally. |
| **calldata** | Read‑only data location for function inputs (external/public), especially for arguments. ▸ Immutable during function execution.  [oai_citation:2‡Medium](https://medium.com/coinmonks/solidity-storage-vs-memory-vs-calldata-8c7e8c38bce?utm_source=chatgpt.com) | ✅ Cheap for function args <br> ✅ No copying overhead <br> ✅ Cannot mutate <br> ❌ Only for external/public function inputs <br> ❌ Cannot be used for mutable local data once inside function | Use for external/public function parameters when you don’t need to modify them; good for large arrays or data inputs to save gas. |

---

## Other “State” Types & Concepts

- **State Variables / Constants / Immutable**
    - `constant` / `immutable` variables: stored in bytecode or initialized once; cheaper than regular storage.  [oai_citation:3‡Medium](https://medium.com/coinmonks/solidity-storage-vs-memory-vs-calldata-8c7e8c38bce?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    - These are still “storage‑like” but optimized.

- **Return Values**
    - If return type is reference type (array, struct), you often need to specify its data location (memory / calldata) depending on context.

- **Function Visibility** (not exactly data location, but affects usage of these locations)
    - External/public vs internal/private functions affect whether you can use calldata etc.

---

## Examples

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract DataLocationsExample {
    uint256 public storedValue;        // stored in storage

    function readStored() external view returns (uint256) {
        return storedValue;             // reading from storage
    }

    function sumMemory(uint[] memory arr) public pure returns (uint) {
        uint s = 0;
        for (uint i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            s += arr[i];                // arr is in memory
        }
        return s;
    }

    function sumCalldata(uint[] calldata arr) external pure returns (uint) {
        uint s = 0;
        for (uint i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            s += arr[i];                // arr is read‑only in calldata
        }
        return s;
    }

    function setValue(uint256 newVal) external {
        storedValue = newVal;          // writes into storage → persists
    }
}
```
### Can changes to `memory` values be seen by the caller (outside the function)?

No — changes made to data in `memory` inside a function **are not** persisted once the function returns, so the caller (outside the function) cannot see them. Memory is temporary and local to that function execution.  [oai_citation:0‡Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/when-to-use-storage-vs-memory-vs-calldata-in-solidity?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

### Supporting Details

- `memory` is a volatile data area allocated for the life of a function call; when the call finishes, memory is cleared.  [oai_citation:1‡Medium](https://medium.com/%40simon.palmer_42769/solidity-gotchas-part-2-storage-memory-and-calldata-ca697e49d2a7?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- If you want data to persist (be visible outside the function or in future calls), you must use `storage` — that is, state variables stored in the contract.  [oai_citation:2‡Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/when-to-use-storage-vs-memory-vs-calldata-in-solidity?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- Passing arguments via `memory` or creating local variables in `memory` allow you to modify them *inside* the function, but these modifications are lost when returning or finishing execution.  [oai_citation:3‡Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33839154/in-ethereum-solidity-what-is-the-purpose-of-the-memory-keyword?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

### Example

```solidity
contract Example {
    uint public stored;  // this is in `storage`

    function modifyMemory(uint[] memory arr) public pure returns(uint[] memory) {
        arr[0] = 123;  // change in memory
        return arr;    // the caller gets the return value, but storage is unaffected
    }

    function modifyStorage(uint[] memory arr) public {
        stored = arr[0];  // writing to storage — persists beyond the function
    }
}
```

### Differences Between `sumMemory` vs `sumCalldata` Examples

Here are what changes when you use `memory` vs `calldata` for a function parameter like `uint[] arr`:

| Aspect | `sumMemory(uint[] memory arr)` | `sumCalldata(uint[] calldata arr)` |
|---|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Mutability of `arr`** | `arr` can be modified inside the function (though in that example it isn’t). | `arr` is **read‑only** ‒ you can’t change its elements. |
| **Visibility & Caller Cost** | More gas used to copy the calldata (arguments) into memory before use. | Cheaper: data remains in calldata, no copy to memory. Saves gas.  [oai_citation:0‡Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/what-is-the-difference-between-memory-and-calldata-in-solidity?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| **Where function can be called from** | `public` allows both internal & external calls. | `external` expects calls from outside; calldata parameters are only allowed for external visibility.  [oai_citation:1‡Ethereum Stack Exchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/74442/when-should-i-use-calldata-and-when-should-i-use-memory?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| **Gas efficiency** | Slightly higher gas cost (because copying into memory, allocation, etc.). | Lower gas cost, especially as `arr.length` or size grows.  [oai_citation:2‡Medium](https://medium.com/coinmonks/solidity-storage-vs-memory-vs-calldata-8c7e8c38bce?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| **Use case** | Good when you need to modify `arr`, or when parameter passing from internal callers. | Best when just reading data from passed arguments, and no mutation. |

---

### Summary & Rule of Thumb

- Use **`calldata`** if function is `external`, you only *read* the incoming dynamic data (arrays, strings, structs).
- Use **`memory`** if you plan to modify the parameter values, or need to work with data in non‑external/internal contexts.
- Cost difference may be minimal for small arrays; but for large arrays, `calldata` gives noticeable savings. ```

## How to Choose Between `calldata` vs `memory` in Solidity

Here’s a guide + heuristics to help decide when to use `calldata` vs `memory` for function parameters or local data.

---

### Key Differences

| Property | `calldata` | `memory` |
|---|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Mutability | **Immutable** — you cannot change the data | **Mutable** — you can modify the values |
| Lifetime | Exists for the external call only, then gone | Exists during function execution, then discarded |
| Cost | Lower gas if reading only (no copying needed) | Higher gas when copying or modifying |
| Use with function types | Only usable for external function parameters (dynamic types) | Usable more broadly inside logic and for arguments that need modification |

---

### When to Use `calldata`

- Function parameters that are dynamic types (arrays, bytes, structs) and **will not be modified**.  [oai_citation:0‡Ethereum Stack Exchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/74442/when-should-i-use-calldata-and-when-should-i-use-memory?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- External functions where you want to avoid unnecessary memory allocation for arguments.  [oai_citation:1‡DEV Community](https://dev.to/turboza/solidity-external-vs-public-memory-vs-calldata-vs-storage-33bg?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- To save gas when reading data only (for loops, read checks) without mutation.  [oai_citation:2‡Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/what-is-the-difference-between-memory-and-calldata-in-solidity?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

### When to Use `memory`

- When you need to **modify** the data inside the function. For example, building or changing an array/struct.  [oai_citation:3‡Ethereum Stack Exchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/74442/when-should-i-use-calldata-and-when-should-i-use-memory?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- When passing data to other functions that expect `memory`. You might need to copy from `calldata` to `memory` in these cases.  [oai_citation:4‡AuditBase Detectors](https://detectors.auditbase.com/calldata-vs-memory-gas-optimization?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- When working inside functions (local variables etc.) where `memory` is the natural fit.  [oai_citation:5‡Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/when-to-use-storage-vs-memory-vs-calldata-in-solidity?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

### Heuristic / Rules of Thumb

1. **Default to `calldata`** for external function parameters if no mutation is needed.
2. Use `memory` if you will modify the data or pass it to functions that require mutable arguments.
3. Always prefer read-only and cheaper styles if performance / gas cost matters.
4. If you see many copies / conversions between storage ↔ memory ↔ calldata, reconsider the data flow.

---

### Example Snippets

```solidity
// Good: use calldata since we only read the array
function sum(uint[] calldata nums) external pure returns (uint) {
    uint total = 0;
    for (uint i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        total += nums[i];
    }
    return total;
}

// Need memory because we modify the data
function increaseFirst(uint[] memory nums) public pure returns (uint[] memory) {
    nums[0] = nums[0] + 1;
    return nums;
}
```

## `uintX` Types in Solidity

- Solidity supports unsigned integer types of varying bit‐sizes: `uint8, uint16, uint24, …, uint256`. They increase in steps of 8 bits.  [oai_citation:0‡docs.soliditylang.org](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/types.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- `uint` is an alias for `uint256`.  [oai_citation:1‡docs.soliditylang.org](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/types.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

## Available Sizes

Here are the valid `uintX` types:
uint8, uint16, uint24, uint32, uint40, uint48, uint56, uint64,
uint72, uint80, uint88, uint96, uint104, uint112, uint120, uint128,
uint136, uint144, uint152, uint160, uint168, uint176, uint184, uint192,
uint200, uint208, uint216, uint224, uint232, uint240, uint248, uint256

---

## Details

- Range of `uintX` is from `0` to `2^(X) − 1`. E.g. `uint8` ranges `0`‑`255`.  [oai_citation:2‡GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/solidity/solidity-integers/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- Using smaller sizes can save gas/storage when you know the values will stay within that range.  [oai_citation:3‡Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/solidity-uint?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

If you want, I can also list the **signed** equivalents (`intX`) or practical guidelines when to choose which width.


Yes — other smart contracts **can call external functions** of a contract, subject to visibility modifiers and how the function is defined. Here’s an explanation:

---

## Function Visibility Types

Solidity has visibility keywords for functions:

| Visibility | Who can call it |
|---|-------------------|
| `public` | Anyone: external accounts, other contracts, and internally (within same contract) |
| `external` | Only external calls: from other contracts or transactions; *not* internal direct calls (unless via `this.someExternal()`).  [oai_citation:0‡Metana](https://metana.io/blog/solidity-functions-types-and-use-cases/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| `internal` | Only this contract and derived (inherited) contracts. Not callable via external contract calls.  [oai_citation:1‡Solidity Documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| `private` | Only within the contract that defines it. Not visible to derived contracts or external calls.  [oai_citation:2‡Solidity Documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |

---

## Calling External Functions from Other Contracts

- You can define an **interface** for the target contract, import or reference that interface, and call its external or public functions.  [oai_citation:3‡QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/guides/ethereum-development/smart-contracts/how-to-call-another-smart-contract-from-your-solidity-code?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- Example:

  ```solidity
  interface IMyContract {
      function doSomething(uint x) external returns (uint);
  }

  contract Caller {
      address target;

      constructor(address _target) {
          target = _target;
      }

      function callDoSomething(uint x) external {
          IMyContract(target).doSomething(x);
      }
  }
  ```

## Can `calldata` be used only with `public` or `external` functions?

Here’s what I found:

---

### What Solidity & Community State

- Typically, `calldata` is used with `external` functions, because external functions receive parameters directly from calldata.  [oai_citation:0‡Ethereum Stack Exchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/123169/can-calldata-be-used-in-every-function-visibility?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- The compiler enforces that dynamic reference types (`bytes`, `string`, `arrays`, `structs`) must specify a data location: `memory` or `calldata` when used as function parameters.  [oai_citation:1‡Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/when-to-use-storage-vs-memory-vs-calldata-in-solidity?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- The StackExchange answer states:
  > “`calldata` can typically only be used with functions that have `external` visibility. However, Solidity will let you declare any function with `calldata` as long as you call it with `calldata` arguments.”  [oai_citation:2‡Ethereum Stack Exchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/123169/can-calldata-be-used-in-every-function-visibility?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

### Practical Implications

- **`external` functions** → allowed & most natural use of `calldata`.
- **`public` functions** → you *can* use `calldata` in public functions’ parameters (especially for dynamic types), but internal calls will cause copying from calldata into memory (if you pass on `calldata` parameters).  [oai_citation:3‡Ethereum Stack Exchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/123169/can-calldata-be-used-in-every-function-visibility?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **`internal` or `private` functions** → `calldata` is generally *not* usable (or makes little sense) since those are not called via external calls, so parameters won’t originate in calldata. The compiler often disallows certain uses.  [oai_citation:4‡Medium](https://medium.com/coinmonks/solidity-calldata-how-does-it-work-1dbd35b93c95?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

### Short Rule

- If your function is `external`, use `calldata` for dynamic parameters when you *only read* them.
- If it's `public`, you can use `calldata` but expect cost overhead when called internally.
- For `internal` / `private`, stick to `memory` (or stack) for parameters and locals.
